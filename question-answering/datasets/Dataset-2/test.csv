How does Bag of Words work?,Bag of Words is a method that considers a sentence or document as a 'Bag' containing words.
What is a hyperplane in the context of SVM?,A hyperplane is a decision boundary that separates different classes in the feature space. SVM aims to find the hyperplane with the maximum margin between classes.
What are the main components of an LSTM cell?,"The main components of an LSTM cell include the memory cell (which maintains the long-term state), the input gate (controls what information enters the memory), the forget gate (controls what information is discarded), and the output gate (controls what information is passed to the next hidden state)."
What are some alternative methods to gradient descent for training neural networks?,"Adam, RMSprop, and Adadelta are popular optimization algorithms that address limitations of gradient descent, such as slow convergence and sensitivity to learning rate."
What is the architecture of an autoencoder?,The encoder and decoder are fully-connected neural networks with the code layer representing compressed data.
How does the kernel trick help in SVM?,"The kernel trick allows SVM to operate in a high-dimensional space without explicitly computing the coordinates of the data in that space, using kernel functions to compute inner products."
What is an autoencoder in deep learning?,An autoencoder is a neural network designed to learn efficient representations of data by encoding it into a lower-dimensional space and then reconstructing it.
What role does regularization play in preventing overfitting?,"Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, add a penalty to the model's complexity, discouraging it from fitting noise in the training data."
How does LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) work in fine-tuning models?,"LoRA injects trainable low-rank matrices into each layer of a pre-trained model, allowing only these matrices to be updated during fine-tuning. This reduces the number of parameters to be trained and saves resources."
What is a unigram?,"An n-gram where n=1, meaning a single word."
"What are t-SNE, LLE and Isomap?","t-SNE, LLE and Isomap are non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques."
What is the impact of increasing the number of features on bias and variance?,Increasing the number of features can reduce bias (by providing more information) but may increase variance (by adding complexity and potential noise).
What are word embeddings?,Word embeddings are vector representations of words that capture their meanings and relationships with other words.
How is the length of vectors determined in Bag of Words?,The vocabulary list is first compiled from the document. The vocabulary size is the length of the vectors.
What is TF-IDF?,TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.
Does Word2Vec contain semantic information of the word?,Yes
Explain the difference between on-policy and off-policy reinforcement learning.,"On-policy methods update the policy based on actions taken according to the current policy, while off-policy methods update the policy based on actions taken under a different policy or behavior."
What is the process for converting weights to integers for storage?,"The process involves applying a formula to convert the weights to a decimal value, rounding it to the nearest integer, and then storing this integer value on the hard disk."
Can you give an example of a Decision Tree application?,"An example provided in the document is deciding whether to accept a new job offer. The decision tree considers factors like salary, commute time, and additional benefits (e.g., free coffee) to determine whether to accept or decline the offer."
What is overfitting?,"Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, which leads to poor performance on unseen data."
What happens to a range of old weight values when they are quantized?,A range of old weight values is mapped to a single quantized value due to rounding. This can lead to multiple old values being represented by the same quantized value.
What is the typical architecture of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)?,"A GAN consists of two neural networks: the generator (G), which tries to produce data that is indistinguishable from real data, and the discriminator (D), which tries to differentiate between real and generated data. The two networks are trained simultaneously in a game-theoretic framework."
"What is the difference between ""episodic"" and ""continuing"" tasks in reinforcement learning?","Episodic tasks have distinct episodes with terminal states and resets, while continuing tasks have ongoing interactions with no defined terminal states, requiring different approaches to learning and evaluation."
What is the significance of the ROC curve in binary classification?,"The ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates at various thresholds, helping evaluate a model's ability to distinguish between classes."
What is transfer learning in NLP?,"Using a pre-trained model on a new, but similar, task with fine-tuning."

What are the benefits of Dimensionality Reduction?,The benefits of dimensionality reduction include compressing data reducing storage space requiring lesser computation time removing redundant features and potentially reducing noise.
What are raw features?,"Raw features are the original features obtained directly from the data, before any transformation or processing."
what is AUC?,"As the prediction threshold is changed, the AUC captures the number of correct positive predictions versus the number of incorrect positive predictions."
What is the purpose of using diverse base models in an ensemble?,"Using diverse base models in an ensemble ensures that each model captures different aspects of the data, enhancing the ensemble's ability to make accurate and robust predictions."
What is the Zipf Distribution in NLP?,"The Zipf Distribution describes how a few elements occur very frequently, a medium number of elements have medium frequency, and many elements occur very infrequently."
What is transfer learning in deep learning?,Transfer learning adapts a pre-trained model to a new task by fine-tuning on a smaller dataset.

What is the Perceptron Learning Rule?,"The Perceptron Learning Rule is an algorithm used to update the weights and bias of a Perceptron during training. It involves adjusting the weights based on the difference between the predicted output and the actual target output, multiplied by the learning rate and the input values. This process is repeated iteratively until the Perceptron converges to a solution."
What does False Positive (FP) mean?,False Positive refers to the cases where the model incorrectly predicted the positive class.
