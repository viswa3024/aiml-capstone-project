We can use this to our commercial advantage, e.g.
advertising without the expense.

I like your informal, ""no bones about it"" style, a style I wish more people would adopt.
During the meeting you had made some references about your previous guest which concerned me.
As an employee and shareholder in Enron, it occurred to me that some of the comments would not benefit Enron if they were ever leaked out to the press, (ie.
like the Houston Chronicle article on the PRC process).
I do have one question to ask, with your light hearted comment about ""Air India""; In order to achieve the vision of being the ""World's Leading Company"" do you anticipate we will further develop business activities within existing areas, or do you anticipate Enron becoming involved in entirely new business areas?
In other words, do you see us building new businesses which represent a natural evolution of our current activities, or do you anticipate something more radical?
A couple of months ago you said in an interview that you will continue running the company, in a business as usual fashion, will that change?

79,"These are the reviews that I have completed or nearing completion:  - Dave Duran  - Joe Deffner  - Tammy Sheppherd  - Scott Josey  - Brian Redmond  - Rob Milnthorp  - Janet Dietrich  - Chris Calger  - John Thompson  - Max Yzaguirre  - Jeff Donahue  - Wes Colwell  - Kay Chapman  David, Greg told me that you were going to create a master list of  reviews/reviewers to be completed to ensure that the Wholesale OOC's catches  all commercial and non-commercial direct reports.
I would suggest that we  follow up with a master list for each business unit to ensure that all  reviews are completed across ENA much like the process we undertook at  mid-year.
I would shoot for 100% participation target.
How are we making  out on the NIM/Issues folks in ENA - either out the door or completed plans?

84,"Gareth:  My comments are generally directed toward the Schedule to the ISDA  Master Agreement between the Trust and UBS.
Please note that UBS is aware of  the 12/9/97 master executed between Swiss Bank Corporation and ENA (as it was  attached to the original fax).
The confirms are pretty straightforward.
(1)  Is the Trust an eligible swap participant?
(2)  The Schedule is missing some ""standard"" Enron type provisions (which  were in the Swiss Bank master).
These include:  limitation of liability  confidentiality  setoff    isn't the Trust an Enron affiliate?
this could impact our approach.
(3)  Enron does not agree to the ISDA standard jurisdiction language (which  is non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of NY state and the federal court  in Manhattan; waiver of all objections).
Enron's preference is arbitration.
With GC consent, we agree to other provisions (e.g., specifice courts, waiver  of jury trial, so specific court and no waiver of objections, etc.).
In the  Swiss Bank master, we agreed to NY law, neither party waived any objections  to venue/forum, and parties could sue anywhere.
(4)  Is this master to be limited to this transaction only?
If the Trust  intends to use this agreement for future currency, rate, or other  transactions, we need to consider the impact of caving on our usual terms.
What eventually happens to the Trust?
Also, Rod Nelson in credit is currently reviewing Enron exposure to UBS.

85,"Hi Folks,  Another wild week in the NFL.
We've got Footballguy Scott Luebke's Week 7 Upgrade - Downgrade - Waiver Wire Picks.
Before we get to that though, let me throw out something I posted today on our message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing themselves.
This season has been as tough to predict as any in recent memory and I thought this might be something some of you might need to hear.
From our Message Boards www.footballguystalk.com  One of our message board members was (justifiably) frustrated with watching Trung Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams fared less well as his starters.
My reply to him:  Don't be down on yourself.
That's the nature of the game.
There is no way you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green for Canidate when Canidate was such a question mark last week.
You did what just about every one of us would have done I'm guessing.
It's part of the game.
Is it frustrating?
Sure it is.
But it's still part of the game.
In my local league last week, I took a chance again on Antonio Freeman after starting him for the first few weeks (but not week 5 - Aargh... )   Did it play out?
No, it didn't.
I had guys on my bench who outscored him.
But looking back on everything I knew with Minnesota and Billy Schroeder, it was the right call for me.
I learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football.
You just have to take the best info you can assemble, make your call and let the players do the rest.
Just like a real GM.
You can only do so much.
If you got beat because you didn't know Terry Glenn was out and you started him, well, that's your bad.
But if you got beat because Trung Canidate decided to play the game of his life, and proven RBs Williams and Green did not, well, that's not your fault.
I promise you, if you can predict things to that degree, you need to quit your job and head to Vegas.
Control what you can control.
Bust your butt to know all you can know.
Make the best decisions you can make and be comfortable you've done all you can do.
After that, just enjoy the games.
Trust me, you'll be a better owner because of it.
Ok, let's jump to Scott's report for this week.
Have a great week, everyone.
Joe  /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Upgrades   QB - Tom Brady (Waiver Wire) - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks deserves an upgrade in my book.
More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an interception this season.
When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots' coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make.
There's even some talk that Bledsoe might not return this season.
Right now, Brady deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback.
QB - Tim Couch - The yardage numbers won't win any awards, but the 4 touchdowns in the last 2 games is impressive.
Couch is starting to show signs of becoming a very good quarterback in this league.
Keep in mind, a tough schedule looms ahead for Couch.
However, with the Browns offense improving, he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a keeper league looking towards the future.
QB - Doug Flutie - The Flutie magic continues to strike.
He's not the best fantasy quarterback, but numerous fantasy teams can be aided by inserting Flutie into the lineup.
With Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham staying healthy, Flutie should be considered a top 15 quarterback this season.
With a strong rushing game keeping defenses honest, look for Flutie to post numbers similar to Sunday on occasion.
280 passing yards and 2 scores is respectable against a tough Denver defense.
RB - Anthony Thomas -The A-Train continues to ride into fantasy starting

Sure Power has been funded to implement distributed generation (DG) into a high-availability, energy-intensive application in the data communications industry (i.e.
telecom hotel, financial processing center, internet data center, etc.).
As you know, Sure Power is the world's leading supplier of DG-based systems providing six 9's availability (certified by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology).
Sure Power's patented technology eliminates interconnection issues with the utility, which has been one of the technical inhibitors to widespread adoption of DG.
Sure Power has already aligned themselves with EPRI to assist them with measurement and analysis, but are looking for a partner who has a potential project on the horizon that could benefit from Sure Power's technology and federal funding assistance (as much as $3M).
Please note, the project does not have to be past the internal approval stage to benefit.
Even a potential project that is still being analyzed for viability could receive funding for an initial feasibility study.
Understanding that the high-tech industry is going through trying times, and that many projects have been put on hold; Sure Power has a three-year window in which to apply the funds, so even a project that may not start for eighteen months would work.
The deadline in which to finalize their project package is September 12, so Sure Power would need to have a response from a potential partner no later than COB Tuesday September 4.
Feel free to contact Sure Power directly with any questions.

95,"Per your request,  Attached is the slide we reviewed with Danny today.
It shows the value of contract terminations for NNG for the contract year of 1101/03 to 11/01/04 to be $145 million.
It also shows that the estimated market value is $95 million.
I think for planning purposes however, we would assume that we would contract for the full value of $145 million either through better pricing analytics, new business development projects and/ or Rate Case reallocation to captive customers.
The biggest risk would be the South end TFF of $12 million which we would have a hard time replacing at a $3 million level.
So, depending on your assumptions, 2003 and 2004 could be flat to 2002 margin of $439.1 million -   or, if you take into account  the TFF deterioration, it could be below by $8 to 10 million.
However, this deterioration will be offset by some of the new power plant projects  - in particular ""Pleasant Hill""  which will bring an incremental $6 million in 2004.
I think you also have to assume that other business development projects will come in to help offset the downsides.
Sorry if I rambled a bit too much.
My view is that NNG will have margin targets for planning purposes flat with 2002.
Call me if you wish to discuss.

105,"Business/Financial Desk; Section C  Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts By FLOYD NORRIS  10/24/2001  The New York Times  Page 1, Column 5  c. 2001 New York Times Company  Enron has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities.
In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.
But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer.
In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it.
The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors.
Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25.
But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79.
The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000.
Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets.
But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing.
One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C.
inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday.
One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information.
''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said.
After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment.
''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview.
''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is needed, he said.
But he said he was still recommending the stock.
''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,'' he said.
''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.''
Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C.
inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow.
But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin.
That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility.
The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm.
Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake.
Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares.
Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details.
Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman.
''I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said.
''But let's move on to the next question.''
Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding.
He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed.
Mr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts.
That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not.
He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises.
The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release.
But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement.
The S.E.C.
is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct.
After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company ''will look into providing'' such statements.

115,"As you have heard, Dynegy is terminating the merger agreement today.
Among other things, this means we are now free to pursue other alternatives - which we are actively doing.
As a consequence of uncertainty about the deal - and now Dynegy's announcement - Enron's debt was downgraded to below investment grade levels today by S&P, Moody's and Fitch.
In response to this action, we have initiated a plan to protect value in our core trading and other energy businesses.
At the same time, we are nearing the completion of the business review process announced last week.
Once this process is complete, we will be conducting a comprehensive restructuring of our business.
Regrettably, but unavoidably, this will include the sale of non-core assets and the implementation of a comprehensive cost saving plan, including layoffs.
We are taking these actions to focus our resources on preserving the value of our core businesses, retaining our employees who are key to our future success, and maintaining relationships with our trading counterparties.
This must be our priority to establish a more solid footing for the rest of Enron.
I know you have serious concerns about what this all means for you.
Although, there are no guarantees, you should know that we are still in this fight and remain absolutely committed to protecting the value of the ongoing businesses of Enron.
All I can ask is that we all be supportive of each other, stay focused on our work as best we can, and stick together while we work to overcome these latest challenges.
Even six or so weeks ago, none of us could have imagined that we would be where we are today.
We will not recover in six weeks what we have lost, but we will work to stabilize and then rebuild this great company.
As always, I appreciate the extraordinary contributions each of you make.
Thank you.
Ken

116,"Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.
This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.
To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.
Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.
The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.
This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.
I truly believe Enron can and will survive.
I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.
During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.
I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.
Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.
Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

119,"Ruth,  Welcome to the Fort Pierce Repowering Project, aka ""FPRP"", (now that John has become a traitor err trader).
The following list contains the latest and greatest natural gas needs for this project (if anyone copied notices any discrepancies with my information, I need to know yesterday <- that soon):  Pressure Requirements:  per the Mitsubishi 501F technical specs, required pressure at the inlet is 530psi, however, this does not include losses.
Therefore, the required pressure off of FGT's mainline needs to be 560psi.
Hourly Gas Requirements:  even though we have reviewed various turbine configurations, the amount of hourly gas needed for this project has managed to hover around 2,100mmbtu/hr using 16 hour/day run cycles.
Looping vs Lateral:  we are willing to defer to FGT's recommendation provided that a single meter configuration be used as opposed to a dual configuration.
Timing:  plans are for the plant to be running in a simple-cycle configuration by June '02 and a combined-cycle configuration by Sep '02.
Therefore, we will need pipeline construction completed by Apr '02 for start-up and testing.
Phase VI Strategy:  the plan has been to either get this construction rolled into the Phase VI expansion (it would be the first piece of Phase VI initiated in order to meet our time deadline) or to have the construction covered by FGT's blanket for normal construction.
FGT Deadline:  It is my understanding that FGT needs to finalize the Phase VI plans by April 30, 2001.
That is everything that comes to mind at this time.
If you or anyone has any comments, changes, questions or interesting anecdotes, let me know.

During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his  heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct  reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our  other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.
It was his  failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs  Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.
It is the r elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that  category.

Midcoast had grown from $0 to $600 million in just five years in its industry.
So why did Dan Tutcher decide it was time to stop what Midcoast was doing and merge?

152,"The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.
Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.
This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.
(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)
Feedback and Evaluation Employees will solicit 360?
feedback on their performance via the PEP system.
The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.
The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.
The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.
No overall performance rating will be designated.
?
PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7 ?
Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14 ?
Written evaluations due to HR			January 15  Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.
Compensation Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.
Division Head approval is required.
As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance.
Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.
Relative Talent Reviews Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.
The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.
Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.
Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.
Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.
EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.
Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

162,"Please take a look at Vig's effort to detect price arbitrage behavior on TW  using the same method that Steve Kirk used on Northern.
You'll recall that  Steve's chart on Northern showed an very close correlation between the  calculated arb opportunity and the direction and size of the aggregate  customer imbalances, by month.
Proving once again that TW is just a little  different, that method shows no correlation at all on TW.
I agree with Vig's  conclusion that we should not use this data in the 637 filing.
I tried one alternative reading of the data to see if I could find a  correlation.
Steve's method evenly weights the value of arb opportunities  that occur early and late in a month.
Please tell me if you agree, marketing  folks, but I think a more logical approach would risk-weight the apparent arb  opportunites.
In other words, an apparent opportunity to short TW and sell  the gas for a $.25/mmbtu profit on the 5th of a month is unlikely to generate  arb behavior because a trader has no idea on the 5th what the cash out index  will be at the end of the month.
In contrast, an opportunity to make $.25 on  the 25th of a month, when a trader can calculate pretty closely what the  monthly index will be, is basically free money.
Using that logic, I ignored  any apparent arb opportunites in the first half of the month.
I eyeballed  the timing and size of the arb opportunites (i.e., there's a $.70-.90 arb  opportunity to short TW from the 23d to the end of May, 2000) rather than  using Steve's mathematical approach.
I still didn't see the kind of  correlation I'd expect.
The correlation is directionally positive in only 4  out of 12 months, and the size of the imbalances doesn't even make sense in  the months that correlate on direction.
I give up, and am removing the arb  argument from the daily imbalance section of the draft.
I'll route that  separately.
Thanks to Vig, Susan, Lorraine and Richard for hustling on this analysis.

Dallas is too far from Surfside.
Cost will be $625 for the house for the entire weekend.
So depending on how many people we get the price should be between $60-$100 per person.
Each person will be responsible for their own food, and a sleeping bag/pillow, etc.
No linens are provided, (I'm assuming this means no towels either) but I think they have a grill so that's the important thing.

These have previously been sent to Sue Mara.
However, with her departure, it seemed best to send it to you.
As you probably know, our agreement was that the advice letter review service would terminate as of the end of December.
That's why I have been continuing to review the utility filings and send you summaries.
If the bankruptcy filing means something different for this arrangement, please let me know.

187,"With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows.
Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:  Week of Jan 28:  We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications.
The packets will contain:  Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist  External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration  Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List  Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA).
During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible.
Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.
A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com.
This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.
The Splash page will look something like the following:      Week of Feb. 4:  We will send out a mass mailing to approx.
3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site.
Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.
Week of Feb. 11:  The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).
General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
Trading/Origination Coordination  The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days.
An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

M. Harrell, Sr.;  John R. Harrell; H. M. Harrell, Jr.; John  M. Robinson, Individually, and as  Trustee of the Clayton M. Harrell Trust, and as Executor or the Estate of  William Ehrhardt; Carlyle W. Urban as Trustee of the Harrell 1963 Trust;  Werner G. Zapp; Claud B. Hamill; Doris Key as Attorney-in-Fact for John Fred  Bahr; R. E. Smith; Letitia Zapp Morgan; Floyd Williams, et ux; Paul Kautz, et  ux; Howard key, et ux; Garland Wilson, et ux; Ernest S. Sears, et ux; Doris  Key, Individually; and Ella Koinm.
First Amendment of Unit Agreement was executed by Houston Natural Gas  Production Company on November 22, 1966 providing for additional escalation  in the Minimum Volumes of Dry Gas from the Unitized Formation, as provided in  Paragraph 6.4 of the Unit Agreement, effective after the 25th calendar year.
The Second and Third Amendments of Unit Agreement expanded the acreage  covered by the Unit Agreement from 6,979.478 acres to 7,438.478 acres.
I do  not have copies of these 2 amendments.
At approximately the same point in time Houston Natural Gas Production  Company conveyed an undivided 50% interest in the Unitized Formation to  Houston Pipe Line Company.
The remaining interest of Houston Natural Gas  Production Company was later transferred to HNG Fossil Fuels Company (merged  into Enron Oil & Gas Company) and that interest was transferred to HPL  Resources Company, which is a subsidiary of Houston Pipe Line Company.

Also Soc Gen cancelled their margin line on Friday (Warren wants to make it very clear that it was Soc Gen and not Fimat.)
So far, Fimat is not reducing its trading limit with us but is passing through the NYMEX requirement.
All of our brokers will have the right to do this and I expect them to do so.

197,"The invoices for December 1999 settlement adjustments will be posted by 23:00 today, Friday, September 28, 2001.
The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices.
Transmission  Customers  will  observe adjustments to their settlements to: (1)  recover  costs  related  to  adjustments  made  outside of the billing process;  (2)  adjust regulation penalty charges to zero for suppliers; and (3)  adjust  the  NYISO  clearing account balance to zero for December 1999 settlements.
With  regard  to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these adjustments  could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant data fix.
As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments is   done  outside  of  the  billing  process.
The  total  adjustment  of $581,563.37  was  allocated  across 13,147,961 MWh.
Customers may validate their  respective  adjustments  by  computing  their  ratio  shares  of the $581,563.37  using  5,059,790  MWh  as  the denominator in their respective ratios of their December 1999 load.
Customers will observe a difference in the  denominators  used  in  the  ratio share allocation of this adjustment versus  adjustment  #3.
This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the costs for adjustment  #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment.
Prior  to  October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue   received  from  Schedule  1  charges,  which  were  comprised  of forecasted  uplift  & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred by  adjusting  subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.
In October 2000,  the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that  allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In  order  to  allow  any  changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be settled  through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.
This results in an  over-collection  which  is  being  returned  to  Customers  through  an adjustment  to  their  monthly  balances.
This  billing treatment for the December  1999  settlement  adjustments  resulted  in credits to the market totaling  $5,219,402.09  allocated  across 13,191,237 MWh.
Customers where allocated their portion of adjustment #3 above, based upon their respective ratio shares of the 13,191,237 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for the month.
December  1999  settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to address  the  delay  in  invoicing.
Payments due to the NYISO for December 1999  settlement  adjustments  are due to be received in the NYISO clearing account  on  Monday, October 15, 2001.
Payments due to market participants will  be  made on Friday, October 19, 2001.

But [Thomas] said to them, 'Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.'....
Then [Jesus] said to Thomas, 'Put your finger here; see my hands.
Reach out your hand and put it into my side.
Stop doubting and believe.'""
Thomas said to him, 'My Lord and my God!'""
John 20:25, 27-28 (NIV)  Jesus wasn't hard on Thomas for his doubts.
Despite his skepticism, Thomas was still loyal to the believers and to Jesus himself.
Some people need to doubt before they believe.
If doubt leads to questions, questions lead to answers, and the answers are accepted, then doubt has done good work.
It is when doubt becomes stubbornness and stubbornness becomes a life-style that doubt harms faith.

207,"Michelle,  Kristin Walsh, a manager in Competitive Analysis, is returning from maternity leave on October 15th.
During Kristin's absence, the following changes have occurred in the group, and I just wanted to run them by you before we communicate them to her: 1)  Kristin will only have two direct reports instead of three.
2) Previously, Kristin's team as a whole was responsible for providing ENA (i.e.
John and Louise, as well as traders) with competitive intelligence.
Instead of Kristen just overseeing the ENA process as a whole, Kristin and her two team members will have more specific duties, although Kristin will still be the primary point of contact for ENA.
Specifically, Kristin will gather and provide intelligence info for the Gas Team, and Kelly Holman will gather and provide info for East Power, and  Greg Whitman will do the same for West Power.
Robert Johnston, Kristin's supervisor,  and Scott Tholan, BUL, just felt like the level of service that Kristin's team was providing was not adequate because efforts were duplicated and Kristin could not provide enough ""face time"" with the head traders to gather and relay info, as well as directing her team.
Also,after Kristin's departure, it was learned that Kristen signed a contract for which she had no authority.
Although Scott does not think that this has happened before, this particular contract blew up in their face.
Upon Kristin's return, Scottt, Robert, and I would like to communicate these changes to her (not in writing, just verbally), and just reitterate the fact that only Scott has the authority to sign contracts.
Additionally, we would like to tell Kristin that she needs to take a management training class so that she can learn to delegate and oversee responsibilities of the group, rather than micromanaging them.
Please let me know if this is going to create any additional problems, or if I need to take a different approach.

217,"Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.
This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.
In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.
We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.
Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.
We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.
In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.
For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.
In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.
This quarter they are reported separately.
Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.
Following are the highlights of our businesses:  Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.
Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.
Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.
While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.
Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.
So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.
Transportation and Distribution: 	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.
This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.
Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.
This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.
Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.
Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.
This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.
Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions.
This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.
In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.
Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.
These charges include: ?
A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp. ?
$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.
This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?
$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.
With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

228,"KUDLOW'S TAKE by Lawrence Kudlow   MARKET YOUR CALENDAR Washington needs to come to its senses.
Economic recovery is just around the corner, if you're to believe leading officials at the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the White House.
By ""recovery"" they mean a 3% growth rate next year, with high expectations that clear rebound evidence will surface during this year's fourth quarter.
But judging by the continued stock-market plunge, the public is not buying what the government is selling.
This has been one of the worst summer stock markets in recent history.
The much-heralded summer rally never materialized.
In fact, despite repeat Fed rate cuts and a federal consumer tax rebate, the technology-driven Nasdaq has lost another 25% of its value in the past three months, with the broader S&P 500 index dropping 15%.
Traditionally, stock markets are a leading indicator of the economy.
When markets began hemorrhaging last summer and fall, they correctly signalled the onset of a business slump.
This has happened many times in economic history.
Going back 20 years, during the early Reagan administration, national economic gloom was punctured by a big stock-market rally in the second half of 1982 which correctly heralded the long prosperity boom.
But it's not happening now.
Actually, applying a normal six-to-nine-month lead time, stock markets are beginning to signal that no recovery will occur until the second half of next year.
Investor spirits and business confidence continues to sink.
A daily drum beat of bad earnings reports has overwhelmed the stock markets.
Some of the numbers are startling: semiconductor profits are off 85%; telecommunications are down 72%; durable-goods are makers off 77% - all for the second quarter.
Leading surveys now predict an incredible 67% additional drop in technology profits for the third quarter, and perhaps another 40% drop in the fourth.
The real message coming from the equity market is that the economy is getting worse, not better.
Undoubtedly, some of this pessimism springs from a rather looney-tune debate in Washington, where leading Democrats are ranting over dwindling budget surpluses, virtually foreclosing any hope of additional and much-needed tax-cut stimulus.
Al Gore's old lockbox for Social Security trust funds has resurfaced.
And the Bush administration, which is favorably inclined toward business tax cuts, increasingly finds itself boxed in by Social Security scare tactics.
But there are signs of sanity in Washington.
Dan L. Crippen, the head of the Congressional Budget Office, testified that ""the attention given to what's in the Social Security trust fund come 2015, or even if the trust fund exists at that point, is misplaced,"" adding that ""the payroll taxes will have no changes due to the president's tax cut.""
Then, in the most sensible statement to come out of Congress on this debate, Crippen noted, ""What will matter is the size of the economy.""
Bravo.
Crippen for president, or Fed chairman, or something.
The size of the economy and its ability to grow is the absolute keypoint that is being ignored in this dreary, Herbert Hoover-like budget debate.
While the Bush tax cuts passed by Congress are a move in the right direction over the long term, in the short run they are having little or no effect.
Retailers around the country are reporting virtually no evidence that the tax rebates are boosting sales.
Even more to the point, the nation is faced with a supply-side business downturn, not a consumer demand-side decline.
It's as though the government economic doctors, having made the wrong diagnoses, are now prescribing the wrong remedy.
On the monetary side, the Fed is finally ending its scorched-earth deflation by cutting interest rates and expanding the money supply, which will propel aggregate demand, not supply.
Yet, the collapse of business investment, production, and profits is a supply-side, or investment-side, problem.
The right remedy would be across-the-board tax reform to boost work effort and capital formation through lower tax-rate incentives on individuals and businesses.
But the tax-rate reduction in the Bush plan doesn't kick in for five years.
And with Democrats ranting over the holy budget surplus, the chance of true business tax relief - including measures such as capital gains and accelerated depreciation allowances - are minimal.
The Fed, the White House, and the Treasury should heed the message of the real-world stock market.
It is clearly telling us that the economy could be much worse, and that the role of government policy should be much more stimulative on both money and taxes.
A combination of supply-side tax cuts and greater Fed stimulus will grow the economy, protect Social Security, increase long-term budget surpluses, and preserve America's role as world leader.
The sooner Washington comes to its senses the faster economic recovery will begin.

My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.
Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.
I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.

237,"This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.
The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.
These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.
Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.
FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY  Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is not, allowed under negotiated rates.
In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines.""
Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an ""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. (RP96-312, et al.)
and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals.
While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an ""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed.
""However, if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not include any such provision.""
A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,"" FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned.
Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become ""muddled.""
Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense"" approach.
The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

If S&P is including the city where FUNB is headquartered  as part of their legal name, then S&P is wrong.
FUNB has asked that we  forward the S&P document that you are looking at.
(2)  [re:  FUNB request to provide us with First Union Corp. financials and  your response that it's OK if First Union Corp. signs on as a guarantor] FUNB says that First Union National Bank doesn't prepare annual statements.
FUNB can provide quarterly call reports (with YTD info) which is also  available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov).
FUNB annual financials also  available on EDGAR.
I don't know what a call report is and FUNB did not  offer up First Union Corp. as a guarantor.
(3)  [re:  10 year bonds which you agreed to accept as Eligible Credit  Support] I don't know what the ""usual haircut"" is on these issues.
You said 90% or  95%.
Legal no longer offers up bonds in our documents which is why we  haven't discussed haircuts lately.
(4)  [re:  the Specified Conditions of Tax Event, Tax Event Upon Merger and  Credit Event Upon Merger] FUNB would rather terminate than collateralize Transactions (and eliminate  obligations to transfer in avoidance of termination).
If a Specified  Condition exists, then there is no obligation to deliver collateral to that  party (experiencing the Specified Condition) and a Secured Party could  exercise all remedies available to it against the Pledgor.
(I think that we  have a different philosophy in that we would prefer to preserve  Transactions).
I'm more willing to give in on the tax events (but global  mergers could force that issue and the agreement basically requires the  Affected Party to try to transfer the Transaction to avoid termination).
Please let me know if you have any questions.

241,"ISDA PRESS REPORT - OCTOBER 29, 2001  CREDIT DERIVATIVES 	*	Pricing Synthetic CDO's - Derivatives Week  REGULATORY 	*	CFTC makes amendments to CFMA 2000 - Risk News  TRADING PRACTICE 	*	Banks tout economic derivatives - IFR  Pricing Synthetic CDO's Derivatives Week - October 29, 2001  Traditionally collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) involve a transfer of collateral assets.
The CDO liabilities then reference the cash flows (principal and interest) of the collateral assets.
But CDOs are increasingly issued in synthetic form, where there is no physical transfer of collateral.
In these structures the CDO references default losses, rather than the cash flows of the referenced collateral.
Credit Default Swaps   In their simplest form synthetic CDOs are akin to single name credit default swaps.
A credit default swap is a contract where one party ,the protection buyer, makes periodic payments in exchange for payments contingent on a credit event.
In a single name credit default swap, the credit event is the default of a single issuer.
Thus, the price of the credit default swaps reflects the market's view of the default likelihood of the reference name.
In unfunded form a synthetic CDO is essentially a basket default swap.
In this case, in return for a premium, the protection seller makes contingent payments based on the default losses incurred by a portfolio or basket of assets.
The protection may be for first loss or equity, in which case the seller pays for the initial default losses, up to some threshold; second loss or mezzanine, where the seller pays losses beyond the first loss threshold up to some higher limit; or senior, where the seller pays all losses beyond a threshold.
Synthetic CDOs may also be structured in funded form.
The simplest form of this structure is a combination of a risk free bond and a basket default swap.
The initial investment is used to purchase the risk free bond and at the outset the investor receives the risk free rate of interest from the bond as well as premium payments from the basket default swap.
As losses occur on the reference portfolio the principal of the bond is reduced to pay the required contingent payments.
At the maturity of the structure the investor receives the remaining principal of the risk free position.
In both funded and unfunded forms the pricing of synthetic CDOs is primarily a matter of pricing the basket default swaps themselves.
Correlation Products   It is often said that synthetic CDOs are correlation products because their value depends not only on the probability of default for each individual name in the reference portfolio, but also on the correlation between those names.
Consider a simple case where the reference portfolio consists of two names, each with a 5% probability of default.
Assume two levels of protection, one paying on the first default, and one paying on the second.
If the names are independent, then the probability that the first loss protection is triggered is 1 - (0.95)2 = 9.75%, that is, 100% less the chance that there are zero defaults.
The probability that the second loss protection is triggered is (0.05)2 = 0.25%, that is, only if there are two defaults.
On the other hand, if the defaults are perfectly correlated, then there are only two possibilities: either both or neither of the names default.
Thus, the probability that either protection is triggered is the probability that both names default, or 5%.
Note that for the first loss protection the increased correlation has reduced the likelihood that the protection is invoked, and therefore reduced the fair price of this protection.
For the second loss piece, the increased correlation has increased the trigger likelihood and fair price.
The relationship between correlation and pricing holds generally for the first loss and most senior levels of protection in basket default swaps.
For the first loss piece, since losses are capped, the pricing is driven primarily by the likelihood that no losses occur, which increases with correlation.
For the senior piece, the pricing is driven by the likelihood that an extreme loss occurs, which is greater in cases of higher correlation.
Pricing   Based on the discussion above most pricing models require individual default probabilities and a correlation across the names in the pool.
Since individual default probabilities can often be obtained from single name credit-default swaps correlation is the main pricing parameter for synthetic CDOs.
Consider an example structure with USD36 million of collateral, where first loss protects against the first USD5 million of losses, second loss protects against the next USD10 million of losses, and the remaining losses are protected by the senior tranche.
We can model spreads on each of these tranches at different correlation levels.
For example, using a correlation of 45%, we obtain model spreads of two basis points, 250bps and 1,642bps for the senior, second loss, and first loss protection respectively.
We can repeat this exercise at different correlation levels to obtain the sensitivity of spreads to changes in correlation.
Figure 1 shows the normalized cost of protection for each tranche at different correlation levels.
We can see that the cost of protection for the senior tranche increases with increasing correlation, that is the cost increases as senior debt gets riskier, while the first loss protection cost decreases with increasing correlation, that is the cost decreases as equity gets less risky.
Note that, in this particular example the cost of second loss protection behaves like senior as an increasing function of correlation.
Implied Correlation   We can back out an implied correlation for each tranche from CDO prices in the same way we would obtain implied volatility from option prices and the Black-Scholes pricing model.
An implied correlation extracted in this fashion depends on the specific CDO pricing model, but the observations above hold generally.
Suppose the market spreads for our example structure are 2bps, 150bps and 2,000bps for the senior, second loss, and first loss protection respectively.
We can compare these observed spreads with our model spreads to calibrate a correlation parameter for each tranche.
For example the model spread is equal to the observed spread for the senior tranche, 2bps, when we price it using a 45% correlation.
In other words, the implied correlation for the senior tranche is 45%.
The implied correlation for each tranche can be inferred from Figure 1 as the correlation level with which our pricing model recovers the observed market spread.
We can see that for the first and second loss tranches, the implied correlation is roughly 20%, while for the senior tranche the implied correlation is 45%.
A first application of the implied correlation is to mark to market a synthetic tranche on an ongoing basis.
As we observe changes in the spreads for the individual names in the pool, we can reprice the tranches above by assuming the correlation level is constant, but updating the spreads.
Additionally, implied correlations can be used for relative value analysis.
For example, senior and second loss tranche protection increase in value as correlation increases.
Since both tranches depend on the same basket of names, we would expect them to have a similar implied correlation.
As mentioned above, the implied correlation of the senior tranche (45%) is significantly higher than that of the second loss tranche (20%).
This means that senior protection is expensive relative to second loss protection.
We can also perform relative value analysis across deals if we believe that the pools in two different CDOs have similar characteristics, in terms of credit quality, industry, and geographical distribution.
For example, if two CDOs have similar pools and structure we would expect to observe comparable implied correlations for their senior tranches.
All else being equal, a discrepancy in implied correlation can serve as an indicator of a discrepancy in price between the two structures.
CFTC makes amendments to CFMA 2000 Risk News - October 29, 2001 By Naomi Humphries  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has released the final rules relating to the trading of equity futures products in the United States.
These rules implement provisions of the Commodity Futures Modernisation Act of 2000 (CFMA) that lift the 19-year ban on the trading of single-stock and narrow-based stock index futures in the US.
The final rules are in line with the new CFMA statutory provisions regarding the specification of listing standards and conditions for trading security futures products.
The rules also establish requirements related to the self-certification of rules and rule amendments, reporting of data, speculative position limits, and special provisions regarding the contract design for the cash settlement and physical delivery of security futures products.
The CFTC received comment from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the American Stock Exchange (Amex) and the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG).
The CFTC adopted several revisions consistent with comments, but stated: ""Generally, the commentators supported the proposed rules.""
The CFTC also streamlined the trading process in its revisions of rules governing commodity futures and options intermediaries on October 19, following the enactment of the CFMA and the resulting revisions to the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).
Key rules governing intermediaries, including futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisers, have been revised to provide greater flexibility consistent with the mandate of the CFMA to streamline and eliminate unnecessary regulation for entities registered under the act.
They include a provision for retail customers to have broad access to registered derivatives transaction execution facilities, by permitting them to trade through a commodity trading adviser with $25 million or more in assets under management, and a proposal to replace the current prescriptive rule over ethics with a statement of acceptable practices.
The CFTC claimed that comments from Fimat, a registered futures commission merchant, and securities broker-dealer, Exchange Analytics, an ethics training provider, the CBOT, the National Futures Association and the Managed Funds Association, all generally supported the adoption of the proposed amendments for commodity futures and options intermediaries.
It added that the issue that generated the most discussion was ethics training.
Acting chairman at the CFTC, James Newsome, said: ""These rules are just the first step in the Commission's review of appropriate regulatory relief for intermediaries.
We have begun the intermediary study that Congress directed us to perform, and we may well be implementing additional regulatory reforms prior to the study's conclusion.""
Banks tout economic derivatives IFR - October 29, 2001  Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan will be using an auction mechanism to deliver the new derivatives products, which they say will be self-clearing and self-hedging.
The solution licensed to the two banks to create derivatives on economic statistics will also be applicable to corporate earnings and revenues, mortgage prepayments, equity prices, central bank target rates, index-related products, electric power, weather degree days, credit or any event-driven market where the development of risk management tools has been constrained by illiquidity, according to the developer of the solution, New York-based Longitude.
""Once the mechanisms are up and running and validated, we could envision structured notes on swaps linked to the auction process itself,"" said JP Morgan Chase's Chris Harvey, managing director of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives sales for the Americas.
Deutsche Bank has picked Germany's lfo and Japan's Tankan as the debut products for its economic derivatives franchises in Europe and Japan.
JP Morgan Chase is still in the process of selecting its inaugural US economic statistics product.
JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank declined to disclose the cost of their franchise on the economic derivatives.
To retain their exclusive agreements with Longitude for the Parimutuel Digital Call Auction (PDCA)-enabled derivatives, the banks must meet performance benchmarks.
Longitude charges a fee based on the notional volume cleared through its system.
Using Longitude's PDCA bookrunner product, Deutsche Bank, for example, would engage in pre-marketing or preselling activity that is similar to that in a bond or equity syndicate offering, followed by a short auction period.
During the auction period, the bank would submit orders to buy or sell digital options on the economic data covered to Longitude's web-based system.
Upon receipt of the orders, Longitude's system produces bid/offer prices for the derivatives being offered, and other relevant market equilibrium statistics, such as limit order books.
Longitude routes this information back to the bank, which publishes the statistics for its customers.
In this example, Deutsche Bank would be counterparty to transactions that are filled.
An order that is filled would result in an International Swaps and Derivatives Association-documented transaction.
The filled orders should hedge themselves because in a pari-mutuel system all claims that end in-the-money are funded by those out-of-the-money.
""Longitude's clients can offer derivatives without assuming additional risks on their own balance sheets,"" said Andrew Lawrence, chief executive of Longitude.
As the systern accepts orders with limit prices, capital markets participants can have a high level of price certainty.
In a pari-mutuel system, prices are market-driven and determined by customer participation, rather than a model or subjective assessment of the price of risk.
Doubfers ""A pari-mutuel model is a demand and supply based market, so the question becomes: Will there be enough participants?""
said Richard Sandor, chief executive of Environmental Financial Products and one of the architects of the interest rate futures markets.
""Is it view taking or [traditional] hedging?
I'm not sure,"" said one bulge bracket firm's head of market risk management.
Numbers of participants are difficult to predict because they will depend upon the design of the specific auction, said Longitude's Lawrence.
""Perhaps as few as 10-15 total orders can form a very rich auction equilibrium,"" he said.
The cost of operating the call auction is another consideration.
A high transaction charge will mean less money for the winners.
""It varies from market to market.
But because banks are not taking market risk, the price for the service will be modest,"" said Lawrence.
""In general, it has always been considered extremely desirable to disaggregate risk factors to the fullest extent possible because they can always be easily recombined.""
""Let's assume a health maintenance organisation (HMO) wishes to hedge out its exposure to annual medical cost inflation in the US, and that the health industry accounts for slightly less than 20% of US gross domestic product.
What can this HMO do now in the traditional markets to mitigate this risk?
Not much.
But JP Morgan could offer derivatives based directly upon this very important measure in order to offer a risk management product for this HMO,"" he said.
Both JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are expecting early interest from financial institutions, and fixed-income participants in particular, because no mechanism for isolating and hedging or speculating on the growth rate of a country's economy currently exists.
Deutsche Bank's strategy for introducing the new products will initially hinge on drumming up internal interest, said Kevin Rodgers, global head of currency options at Deutsche Bank in London.
In January, the bank's trading desks will start using it internally to hedge their own positions.
This activity will be useful in providing the bank with probability distributions, he added.
Deutsche Bank will then try to get other banks' proprietary and swap desks to use the system.
The new products will probably be available for use by hedge funds, commodity trading advisers and fund managers by the third quarter of next year.
JP Morgan Chase expects to start its franchise market on US economic statistic derivatives next month.

250,"As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.
Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.
This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.
The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.
Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.
Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.
From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.
Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.
We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.
Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.
This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.
By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO.""
This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.
Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.
We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.
It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.
The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.
We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.
As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.
This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.
We will update you periodically on our process.
Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.
Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.
Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.
Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.
In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.
Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.
In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.
Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.
Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.
As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.
Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:  Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman  Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.
We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.
Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.
We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.
We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

Item Two  I purchased 99 mw's from City of Austin for tomorrow,  hours ending 7-22 under the Ercot Asset book.

Awesome day.
Not a single cloud in the sky.
About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.
We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen.
The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.
Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans.
They are taunting me.
I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar?
The rules are similar.
I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable tickets, either!
You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down.
He is unworthy.
I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable.
Price: $712.
He is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame.
I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans.
I am KING and these are my subjects.
I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses.
I RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff.
Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit.
I pour another stiffy from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.
I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants.
While I am standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone.
Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0.
I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom: ""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock.""
He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants.
I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me.
Surprisingly, they are equipped with a flask full of vodka.
I send them off to purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka.
I have not lost faith.
Nebraska is a bunch of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka.
The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.
I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0.
I am beginning to lose faith.
This normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock.
I am enraged by this policy.
I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat.
All of a sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts.
""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my coma, ""Iz we winnig?
Did wez scort?""
Alas, the answer is no, we were not winning and we did not score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"", and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.
I cheer wildly.
I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it.
I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck.
I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too drunk to form complete sentences.
With my last cognitive thought of the evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October, they would be playing Florida State for the national championship.
6:30 Back in the car.
On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off.
We can still salvage the day!
I crack open a beer.
It is warm.
I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas.
I am hungry.
I go inside the store.
I walk past the beer frig.
I notice a Zima.
I've never had a Zima.
I wonder if it's any good.
I pull a Zima from the frig.
I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows.
Zima sucks.
I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store.
I walk to where the ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub.
There is no one there.
I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives.
I eat them.
I am still hungry.
I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami.
I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me.
I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin.
I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour.
My truck-mate is tired of my singing.
He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit excessive.
Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.
I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center.
My truckmate, against my loud and profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.
I tell him he's an idiot.
I tell him we will never get out.
I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here.
He ignores me.
I think he's still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes.
I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying.
I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants.
We're going to kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29.
I am pleased.
I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today.
I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice.""
There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom.
I am disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a ""Niiiiiice cock.""
No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.
Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center, much less Bud Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?""
I tell him (no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs.
Would you mind throwing this away for me?""
I take the last swig and hand it to him.
He is confused.
I pretend I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead.
I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people and sit down.
The usher walks by harmlessly.
I am giggling like a little girl.
I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost.
In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lost my bearings.
I have no ticket stub.
I cannot find my seats.
Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs.
I am enraged.
I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it.
A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.
However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye.
I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt.
""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing.
I'm so drunk I am swaying and grunting.
I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye.
My pants are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist.
I look like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost.
I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits.
I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage.
I walk up six flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck.
I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.
I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap.
I see my friend in the driver's seat.
I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.
I am too tired to punch my friend.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:58 I am jostled.
The truck is moving.
I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor.
I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility, and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below.
My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister.
I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving.
We are out of beer.
I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers.
I am happy.
I return to my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility.
We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him.
We are all going to die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet.
We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's.
Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.
We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've been working this door for almost a year.
I've been working doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you in.""
We attempt to reason with him.
He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in.
We take two steps in the door and hear ""Last call for alcohol!""
I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't that fuckin' hard.
Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street.
We need food.
We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60.
We give him $10 and tell him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait.
We give the hostess $50.
We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives.
We are all asleep with our heads on the table.
The waiter wakes us up.
We eat every fucking bit of our food.
Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted.
We don't give a shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.
As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.
Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.
Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.
JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.
Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.
Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!
We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.
The theme for the walk this year is ""Mission: Possible"" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.
The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

The tariff permits us to agree to such alternate point and the rate.
We are not required to agree to such alternate point use under the tariff.
Therefore, we do not have to grant this right beyond that which we want, which in this case is a month.
If pressed by BP, we should respond that we are only prepared to agree to such alternate point use for a month.
For those of you unfamiliar with the Global Settlement, the reason we have the right to agree whether we want to amend a customer's  primary or alternates outside the path was to give us the opportunity to recoup the turnback costs.
In other words, by not agreeing in certain instances we may receive incremental revenues to recoup the turnback costs which we are now 100% on the hook for.

339,"Dear Ken,             I would like to apologize for not responding to the survey at the beginning of September.
It wasn't a statement or anything.
We were just up to our ears in a project that had to go out on the Wednesday following Labor Day.
And the ""well, I'll fill it out during lunch"" is never a really good idea.
Lunchtime disappears so quickly.
So by way of apology I am sending you this letter with some thoughts and observations about life at Enron.
I hope you don't think I'm ""line jumping"" by doing this.
But I've observed that surveys often get you information you want, not information you need.
The numbers on the survey look good.
But there's always room for improvement.
I'm very pleased that you're once again involved in the day-to-day operations.
I'm also very glad that you're emphasizing our values.
I have to admit that they weren't the reason I came to Enron-I needed a job-but as soon as I was here, they became a major reason for staying.
It's not just another job, if the values are believed and followed.
The perks are nice, but I bet that the values have as much to do with our being named a great place to work as anything else.
I wonder, though, if everyone shares my-our-view.
There was a rumor going around the day after the all-employee meeting that senior management was not happy when you announced we were going to reaffirm our values.
That strikes me as a little too soon after the meeting to be totally credible, and I really can't picture senior management telling people what they really think about our values or anything, if they really think that way.
I also don't doubt that it's true.
We seem to have gone from a company that treasures its intellectual capital and people to one where reorganizations and ""disappearances"" are more the order of the day.
Although it's gotten a little better, our values right now seem to be FUD-a computer industry term for fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
Many people-myself included-spend a lot of time looking over our shoulders as we go through seemingly constant reorganization and reevaluation, waiting for the other shoe to drop-on us.
Rumors (the whole unit is being phased out) were rampant, and it didn't help when the PEP scores came out with no indication why (really low) scores were given, or, more importantly, how we could go about improving our performance.
This doesn't strike me as the best way to increase productivity or esprit d' corps.
We need to add value to the values.
As part of my initial orientation, Joe Sutton asked us to define and give examples of our values.
A couple of months later, Jeff Skilling addressed ""Enron at a Glance.""
He spent serious time explaining the importance of the values, too.
Hey, I thought, these guys are serious about this stuff.
Since then, though, all my reinforcement about our values comes from the elevator, right after The Building Guy.
Last spring, we were all trooped over to the Doubletree to see the harassment players, costing a fair chunk of time and money, I'm guessing.
So which, in my puny little brain, is more important?
Where the dollars go, or the occasional reference in what somebody considers otherwise dead time?
There are ways we can adjust.
I would like to suggest two possibilities.
First, I would like to propose a refresher course in our values.
Take time out of our days.
Get in experts.
Hire a hall.
Give us cookies.
Heck, maybe even lunch.
Make the bigwigs in each unit do off-sites.
They like off-sites.
We'll get the idea.
This is important.
One other notion.
You may recall bumper stickers that read, ""Commit Random Acts of Kindness.""
I would like to suggest a ""Random Acts of Values"" award.
Actually, I wouldn't want to make it an award.
""Random Acts of Values"" recognition?
captured?
Maybe.
I'll keep doing the day in and the day out, because it's the right thing to do, not because of an award.
But recognizing what we think is important might give a boost to some other people.
It will at least raise the profile.
And it would also tell us something if the recognition was going to everyone except senior management.
I'd really hate to see my rumormonger proven true.
I know we have the Chairman's Award.
But I'm no Mark Herada.
I would need two lifetimes to do half of what he's done.
The Chairman's Award is really important, and I will nominate someone.
People like Mark truly deserve it, and I know a couple.
But it's one award, once a year.
We should recognize little moments.
I have no idea how we would capture them, and I don't know what to do with a guy who is really respectful today and tomorrow resumes being a jerk.
But we can figure out something.
And I'm suspecting that you really wouldn't be terribly bent out of shape if you had to recognize 20,000 values moments, especially if they were one per person.
Sincerely,

",values,my apologize for not responding to survey,observations about life at enron.,survey details

345,"Can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated?
I am getting mixed information.
I know that we use the higher of the two volumes (receipts vs. deliveries).
The question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume.
Last month (March), we left the volume at the nom of 45,000/day.
In the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume.
For April, the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47,089/day.
James Armstrong is using the actual volume.
The deal for the fee is 514353.
My other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes, receipts, deliveries and transport.
Should the transport volume be in the calculation?
Also, Mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume.
Do I include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom?

380,"Hi, Ken:  I'm a former ECT VP who is just down the street, back at Ryder Scott Company which was my home before my six-years with Enron.
A great six-ears, in fact, I learned much and enjoyed the Company and the company, but it does feel better to be back in the ""oil patch"".
I still have stock and will continue to be a stockholder as I know the company will continue to be innovative and dynamic.
My reason for this email is a recent op-ed piece in the Houston Chronicle by Robert Buzzanco decrying the current campaign against terrorism.
His editorial was at best silly, fraught with inaccuracies (as a geological engineer I rely on facts - minorities make up 34.4% of the combined arm forces - not the opposite as suggested in Buzzanco's piece) and intended only to protract his personal agenda which has nothing to do with peace.
This may be more about selling his anti-American books than current events.
I could really care less about this person, he certainly has the right to conduct his protest, many have fought and died for his right and more may die in the coming days.
I do object to this guy using the University of Houston to lend credibility to his cause.
That's like an Enron employee (purely an example) marching in protests wearing the logo and identifying him or herself with Enron.
He is a private citizen when he writes an editorial or marches in protest.
He used his position at UofH  to get his piece in the paper.
I know you are an alumnus, and I ask you to read his editorial (10/8) and respond according to your hear.
Keep the ship on course, Ken.
Respectfully  Thomas M. Talley

He has several questions regarding the base contract that they have with Enron, and EnronOnline.
For example, if their users logged into EOL under Coast Canada, and transacted on an US product, what underlying agreement would be governed?
From my conversation with Gregg, I believe that they are trying to figure out  what contract applies to what entity, when transacted on EOL.
If you could give them a call they would really appreciate it.

384,"WARNING:  Laptop AC Adapter Recall Program  This recall and replacement program only affects AC adapters on laptop systems with the listed Model Series Number (second list below), not the notebook computers themselves.
We ask that all laptop users in the ETS environment check the number on their AC adapter, and notify us by return email if any of the three model series numbers appear just under the COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION name.
We will centrally manage the replacement of your adapter to insure the replacement adapter is ordered and installed.
In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Compaq Computer Corporation announced a worldwide voluntary recall and replacement program for approximately 1.4 million AC adapters used with certain commercial notebook computer products.
Compaq customers affected by this recall and replacement program will be eligible to receive a replacement AC adapter for each recalled adapter.
These AC adapters were distributed worldwide in notebooks, as separate options, and as replacement spares for the following notebooks:   ?
Armada M300 ?
Armada 100s ?
Armada M700 ?
Armada 110 ?
Armada E500 ?
Prosignia 170 ?
Armada E500s ?
Prosignia 190 ?
Armada V300 ?
Notebook 100 ?
Armada 3500   This recall and replacement program involves AC adapters made by only one of the multiple manufacturers used by Compaq; thus, not every notebook computer listed above will be affected by the recall.
The affected AC adapters can be identified by the adapter Model Series Number located directly under the Compaq Computer Corporation name on the AC adapter label.

I'm sorry to hear that Enron's on some tough times, hope you're area is safe.
Got to love paying Andersen for their quality financial statements huh?
Old AA is in hot water for their F/S for Enron, Waste Management Inc. and couple other companies.
Their getting some pretty bad press and rightfully deserved, since all they've tried to focus on is building up a consulting firm years before the inevitable split with Andersen Consulting (Accenture).
On a personal side, hope you, Anne and the girls are doing ok.  Kim and I move into our new place on Monday.
Of course we were supposed to move in back in September, but what can you do.

398,"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.
In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.
Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.
He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.
Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.
Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets.
He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.
Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.
In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.
I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.
I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.
Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.
But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.
The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.
Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

414,"As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.
The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.
Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.
Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.
But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.
Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.
However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.
Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.
I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.
But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.
I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:  ?
Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.
The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.
?
After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.
As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.
?
The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.
Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.
This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.
These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.

432,"As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.
Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.
This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.
The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.
Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.
Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.
From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.
Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.
We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.
Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.
This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.
By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO.""
This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.
Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.
We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.
It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.
The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.
We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.
As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.
This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.
We will update you periodically on our process.
Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.
Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.
Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.
Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.
In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.
Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.
In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.
Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.
Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.
As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.
Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:  Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman  Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.
We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.
Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.
We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.
We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

We also realize that it=  is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job.
It is our be= lief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities=  of employment may be somewhat diminished.
Finally, we would like to empha= size the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody.
We will i= nterview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions ba= sed on the needs of the office.
Before extending offers we will consider t= he potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron e= mployees in other offices who have been redeployed.
Stated another way, we=  don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enro= n who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people alread= y here at risk.
We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are mor= e certain about the state of affairs in the company.
How Will the Floor Move Play Out?
We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks.
While we = still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause fo= r a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money o= n this.
When talking to the build out team today it became clear that dela= ying would accomplish several goals.
First, it allows us to get final arch= itectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can mo= re precisely peg down the costs before moving forward.
Second, it gives th= e build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move= .
Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes=  sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right n= ow.
While we still think that we are going to move forward with this proje= ct, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do=  right now.
In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team w= ith firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, o= r delay again.
=20  As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, rel= iable information becomes available.
We recognize that this is a very hard=  time for everyone.
Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep=  up the success of this office.

The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.
The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.
The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.
As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.
Additional incentives are currently being developed.
If you are willing to serve as a team captain or a walker, please email or call Sue Wadsworth (713-853-5105) or Melissa Becker (713-853-6641).
We look forward to seeing you November 3 and demonstrating Enron's commitment to fighting heart disease.

472,"ISDA PRESS REPORT - OCTOBER 19, 2001   CREDIT DERIVATIVES 	*	Regulators Seek More Data About Credit Derivatives - Wall Street Journal  LATIN AMERICA *	WORLD NEWS: Brazil's weakness set 'for some time' - Financial Times   OPERATIONS *	Bank of New York demands back-up links from customers - Financial Times   RISK MANAGEMENT *	DTCC seeks to address post Sept 11op-risk concerns - Risk News  Regulators Seek More Data About Credit Derivatives Dow Jones Newswire  WASHINGTON-U.S. bank regulators, saying the notional amount of credit derivatives at banks has increased more than sixfold since 1997, from $55 billion to $352 billion, are proposing new reporting requirements on credit derivatives.
The requirements focus on what are known as bank call reports, which banks file with the federal bank regulatory agencies each quarter; these are used to monitor the condition and risk profile of reporting banks and the industry as a whole.
In a joint notice, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said tile new Items proposed to be added to call reports should result in a ""minimal additional reporting burden"" for affected banks.
WORLD NEWS: Brazil's weakness set 'for some time' Financial Times; Oct 19, 2001 By Raymond Colitt in Sao Paulo   Brazil's financial markets have recovered this week, halting at least temporarily the downward spiral of the Real.
But few analysts support the government's hopes of asustained currency recovery that would allow interest rates to come down and economic growth to resume.
With a tighter monetary policy and somewhat brighter short-term prospects after elections in neighbouring Argentina, the Brazilian portion of the JP Morgan's EMBI+, emerging markets bond index, has narrowed by 133 basis points since October 8.
By mid-week, the Real had recovered to RDollars 2.70, up 4.5 per cent against the dollar from its post-attack low.
Future interest rates also came down by more than 60 basis points this week.
The Real had depreciated 30 per cent against the dollar since the beginning of the year, raising concerns about the country's inflation target and credit outlook.
However, the currency weakness ""is here to stay"", says Marcelo Carvalho, chief economist with JP Morgan Chase, the investment bank, in Sao Paulo.
""The fundamental problems of the Brazilian economy have not changed and the market outlook remains uncertain.""
Indeed, a consensus forecast published by the central bank sees the currency at RDollars 2.80 against the dollar at the end of this year and at RDollars 2.86 by the end of next year.
A sustained currency weakness implies higher inflation and a larger nominal budget deficit, and subsequently slower economic growth, says Mr Carvalho.
JP Morgan Chase foresees GDP growth next year of only 1 per cent, compared to the market consensus of 2.25 per cent next year.
Brazil's principal problem is its dependence on international capital markets and direct foreign investment to finance a current account deficit estimated at USDollars 25bn this year, the largest of any emerging market.
Total external financing requirements are estimated at just under USDollars 50bn next year, a tall order at a time of a global downturn and heightened risk aversion towards emerging markets.
Earlier this month, the economic authorities issued more dollar-linked debt, increased obligatory bank deposits and reformed corporate reporting rules designed to reduce the need for currency hedging.
The economic slowdown these measures helped to trigger will help improve the country's trade balance by driving down imports.
As a result, the market expects the current account deficit to fall from Dollars 25bn this year to Dollars 21.7bn next year.
The domestic slowdown has also helped to dampen inflationary pressure caused by the currency depreciation.
On Wednesday, the central bank decided to maintain its prime interest rate at 19 per cent with a neutral bias.
Yet more action to tighten monetary policy - such as a further increase of bank deposit requirements - may be necessary given the ongoing threat of an Argentine default, an escalation of the US-led war on terrorism and political noise ahead of Brazil's presidential elections next year.
Bank of New York demands back-up links from customers By Joshua Chaffin in New York  The Bank of New York will require some customers to have back-up communications links to its securities processing operations, and will more closely inspect its vendors' technology and communications capabilities to ensure they function in the event of disaster.
Thomas Renyi, chief executive, announced the changes on Thursday when discussing the bank's third quarter earnings, which suffered more than expected from the September 11 attacks.
BoNY, which specialises in securities processing, was one of the Wall Street firms hardest hit by the attacks.
More than a month later, it is still struggling to reconcile trades that clients executed after September 11.
As a result, its disaster recovery plans have been among the most scrutinised by the financial services industry as it tries to prepare for future disasters.
BoNY executives had contended that much of the disruption was due to damaged telecommunications lines.
Mr Renyi reiterated Wall Street's new-found appreciation of ""how important telecommunications are to the smooth operation of the capital markets"".
But he also pointed to problems with computer and communications systems at BoNY's vendors that may have hindered the bank's recovery.
""Some of the things just didn't work as billed by our vendors,"" he said.
Mr Renyi also said that he and other Wall Street executives would re-evaluate the practice of out-sourcing large volumes of business to a small number of companies.
His comments are notable because BoNY has aggressively promoted itself to customers as a single provider for all back-office needs, from trade processing to accounting.
Overall, losses from the disaster cut BoNY's third-quarter earnings by one-third from last year's levels to $243m, or 33 cents a share.
BoNY pointed out that excluding the disaster, earnings rose 6 per cent from last year.
BoNY recorded a $140m charge related to the disaster.
This covers a variety of expenses, from renting office space in mid-town Manhattan to buying computers.
BoNY estimated it lost about $29m in fees from the closure of the markets and problems with its automatic teller machines, and paid about $45m to compensate customers for trades that failed or were slow.
However, it expected that a ""substantial amount"" would be covered by insurance.
DTCC seeks to address post Sept 11op-risk concerns  By Gallagher Polyn  18 October - The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world's largest clearing company, has seized the initiative to address the issue of systemic operational risk concerns raised in the aftermath of the US terrorist attacks of September 11.
DTCC chairman and chief executive Jill Considine held the first in a series of discussions with representatives of the Securities Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, yesterday, to address operational risks exposed by the attacks on the World Trade Center.
In a speech to the Bond Market Association in New York prior to the meeting, Considine said the major systemic risk posed by the September 11 attack stemmed from over-centralisation of physical assets - people and facilities - related to financial markets in New York.
Bond market settlement banks, the New York telephone carrier Verizon's network in lower Manhattan, and numerous market makers on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq were briefly incapacitated by the attack.
US fixed-income markets did not resume trading until September 14, while trading on NYSE and Nasdaq did not resume until September 17.
The Bank of New York, a large custodian and securities settlement bank, had major problems paying out funds due to failed communications lines, with some market sources indicating that Bank of New York's payments backlog reached $130 billion on Thursday September 13, leaving a number of large European institutions with large overdrafts with other banks.
After a 'breather' from weeks of intensive recovery efforts by US regulatory authorities subsequent to the attack, Considine said the DTCC would look to take a leadership role in helping the US financial industry adopt new best practices to manage the newly exposed risks.
Comments made by Considine during her speech suggested the DTCC would hold discussions with regulators, broker-dealers, electronic trading network service providers, clearing houses, and even public utilities like phone companies.
Asked whether new awareness of the risks stemming from spatial concentration would result in calls to disperse financial market operations over wider areas, Considine said, ""I think people are looking at that very seriously.""
But it was unclear whether Considine was referring to regulatory authorities.
Neither the SEC nor the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have yet issued any new regulations related to the attacks, though impact assessment is ongoing, spokespersons for the two organisations said.
The DTCC is the world's largest post-trade infrastructure organisation, providing clearance, settlement and custody services for equities, corporate and municipal debt, exchange-traded funds, mutual funds, ADRs, money market instruments, unit investment trusts and insurance products.

487,"Judge McCartney presented her report on the SE RTO mediation to FERC last Wed.
Her recommendation was for the Grid model: Transco on top/Independent Market Admin.
(IMA) in the RTO (model presented by GridSouth, Grid Florida and Entergy) rather than Southern's model (Gridco on top, transmission owners and ind.
transcos under).
The Commissioners did not make a decision, but stated that they planned to address the SE RTO at the next Commission meeting on Nov 7 (after they have received comments on RTO week).
The judge discussed the biggest obstacles to public power agreeing to the Grid model:  Southern gave them 100% transmission recovery on Day 1 and the Grids had a phase-in (pursuant to the Commission's previous orders in GridFlorida).
I think that many of the publics also liked the fact that Southern gave them full grandfathering of current contracts.
Chair Wood had questions about the split of responsibilities between the transmission-owning transco on top and the IMA and about the fiduciary duties of the transco board.
The judge stated that most publics wanted a non-profit ISO on top.
When Massey stated that most states wanted the traditional non-profit ISO, Wood said: ""that would put the cabosh on this model,"" then asked why the publics don't like the operating agreements with the RTO.
There was discussion about concerns that the transco would favor transmission solutions over gen.  Massey pointed out that the NE ISOs simply don't want their models changed, so that should not keep the Commission from approving the transco-type model.
Breathitt stated that cost/benefit analyses were important, especially for this region of low cost power.
Brownell stated that the Commission needed to act quickly because the market was already putting capital into transcos.

These changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of Monday September 3, 2001.
Stack Manager Changes  Activate/Inactivate Stack - This functionality allows the trader to pull a product's prices from the website without suspending the product.
If the Top of Stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product; therefore, if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website.
If a product's stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager.
If the stack is active it will appear in black font.
To use this feature, select the product, right click and choose ""Inactivate Stack"".
When you are ready to reactivate your prices, select the same product, right click again and choose ""Activate Stack"".
There are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will Activate/Inactivate the stack of the highlighted product.
See screen shot below for the icons.
Changes to Product Properties - Currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen, the product will be suspended and pulled from the website.
Now instead of being suspended, the product's stack will become inactive.
Once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the Activate Stack icon as discussed above.
Website Change  Restrictions on Top of Stack orders - If Top of Stack limit orders are allowed on a product, but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer, limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product.
If you have any questions please call me at 31787.

512,"BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  West Power On August 31, 2001, West Power Origination closed the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Southwest Power to Black Hills Energy Corp.
The sale to Black Hills concluded a two year strategy associated with the acquisition and expansion of the 50MW Las Vegas Cogeneration facility.
The 230MW Las Vegas II expansion project initiated in January 2000 consists of two, 2x1 systems utilizing LM 6000 PC technology in combined cycle.
In May of this year, West Power Origination secured a 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply Company for the entire output of the expansion project.
The Las Vegas II expansion project is currently under construction and is scheduled to go commercial in September 2002.
This transaction utilized many of Enron's technical, financial and commodity capabilities.

News from the Global Flash  EES Europe Celebrates Pirelli Deal EES Europe is celebrating another deal with an attractive brand name after clinching a three-year contract with Pirelli Cables and Systems, the world's leading energy cable manufacturer.
The deal gives EES the right to match bids to supply gas and electricity to 18 manufacturing sites in Italy and the UK.
EES will also assess opportunities for energy management programmes designed to increase energy efficiency at Pirelli's facilities.
Bob Manasse, Vice President Origination of EES Europe, said: ""Congratulations to all those involved for securing EES another great deal which will strengthen our position in Europe and give us a valuable point of entry into the Pirelli tire organization and the recently acquired Telecom Italia.""
German Gas Deal - First Municipality Transaction Signed in BEB Territory  Congratulations are due to the Frankfurt and London-based gas teams who, in the face of tough competition from the Northern German incumbent supplier, BEB Erdgas and Erdoel (a jointly held Shell and Exxon subsidiary), succeeded in securing two gas supply agreements with the cities of Peine and Uelzen on 24th August.
Securing transmission will be challenging due to the fact that BEB has the most onerous grid access terms in Germany.
However, the gas team is hopeful these transactions will bring about a turning point in gaining access to customers within BEB's territory, which until Enron closed on these deals was considered to be the ""heart land"" of Germany.
Enron Names New UK Coal-Hauling Freight Locomotive On Saturday, 1st September, a ten-strong delegation from Enron's coal team traveled up to British Energy's Eggborough coal-fired power station to take part in the naming ceremony for a newly-acquired Class 66 freight locomotive, recently put into service by Enron business partner and rail freight specialist, Freightliner Heavy Haul.
Enron and Freightliner Heavy Haul signed a contract for UK coal transport in June 2000, effectively breaking the local monopoly in the rail transport of coal held by an incumbent rail freight company.
True to form, the introduction of competition has reduced rates and dramatically improved service levels.
Stuart Staley, Enron's international coal group vice-president, praised the dedication of the Freightliner train drivers and staff who have contributed to the success of the service for Enron.
While Eddie Fitzsimons, managing director of Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd noted:  'We only started running coal trains in December 2000 and we have now run more than 17,000 individual wagon journeys containing more than one million tonnes of coal, almost all of that for Enron.'
The coal team selected the name Don Raider from numerous entries received from an earlier Globalflash competition:  ""The new locomotive was named Don Raider, after the river Don, a major river in South Yorkshire where a number of our customers are located,"" explains Tom Kearney, a director in Enron's international coal group who executed the original deal with Freightliner.
""Other ""Raider Class"" Freightliner Heavy Haul locomotives will be named at a later date, each bearing the name of a river which flows near to coal-fired power stations and major coal-importing ports.""
While mischievous Enron employees may think the name sounds suspiciously like a covert activity carried out by the new market entrants, we can assure you that would simply be speculation!
Congratulations again to the Coal team on securing this landmark deal.

The Fighting Scots Soccer Team was eventually defeated by Luther College of Iowa in NCAA play.
*	This past Saturday marked the first of three academic scholarship competition days held on campus.
Typically, this is the smallest of the three days because of its proximity to Christmas, but the number of scholars on campus, compared to last year's first program, increased from 15 to 22.

If you do encounter ""work"" via email or are faced with any ""work"" at all, then to purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words ""I've had enough of your crap...
I'm off to the bar.""
Your brain should automatically forget the ""work"".
If you receive ""work"" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and drag the ""work"" to your garbage can.
Put on your hat and coat and skip to the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum punch).
After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that ""work"" will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that ""Scooby Doo"" was the greatest cartoon ever.

i would add ""well done"" and please ""stay around""!
i would like to follow up on knowing whom i should contact, with your advance permission, for securing legal representation from enron corp. for the firm.
candidly does vicki sharp's position inhibit our serving in that capacity?
i know you approved us 2 years ago but we have not been contacted at all for representation.
we have turned down putative claims against enron for multiple reasons, even those where our role would not have been apparent.
i believe we can provide cost effective, quality representation in multiple areas of expertise (see our web site at www.gpsolaw.com) and enron would be well served.

538,"To the attention of: Dr  Kenneth L. Lay Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Enron   Dear Dr Lay,  2001 was an extraordinary year!
As it draws to a close, I would like to share some of my thoughts with you.
First of all, I wanted to thank our members and constituents for their active engagement during the last 12 months, which helped us to move forward in our efforts to serve as a framework and catalyst for business and society to improve the state of the world.
In 2001 we implemented ""Forum Plus"" strategy, designed to advance critical issues on the global agenda through the creation of task forces and initiatives that integrate business, governments, international organizations, civil society, academics and technical experts.
Today, 11 task forces are already in place.
To provide an intellectual and strategic base for these activities, we have developed and computerized - with the help of our members and constituents - a comprehensive system for monitoring some 200 specific items on the global agenda.
This tracking process provides a foundation for action on these ongoing challenges.
To make our foundation a true multi-stakeholder platform we have created a number of consultative councils (e.g.
with NGOs, world religious leaders, academies of science, etc.)
and have, at the same time, strengthened the role of the business community inside our organization.
It is worth noting that despite the negative trends in the global economy, 2001 was a successful year for all of our activities.
This shows that even in difficult times there is a great demand for increased interaction among global decision-makers, and for top-level community building.
The most difficult decision the Forum had to take this year was to move our Annual Meeting from Davos to New York in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September.
From 31 January to 4 February 2002, leaders from business, governments, academia, religions, the media and civil society will have a first opportunity to develop an integrated response to these new circumstances.
The Annual Meeting 2002 is organized around six major challenges we are facing as a global community:  1.
Restoring Sustained Growth 2.
Achieving Security, Addressing Vulnerabilities 3.
Redefining Business Challenges 4.
Reducing Poverty and Achieving Equity 5.
Sharing Values and Respecting Differences 6.
Re-evaluating Leadership and Governance  The Annual Meeting in New York will be characterized by a workshop-style approach where all participants will have an opportunity to engage in shared learning and to have a collective impact.
The programme is designed to stimulate discussion and provide insights that will help us better cope with the fragility of our times.
The response to our invitations has been overwhelming: All the key personalities will be present.
Please note that this year, instead of sending Christmas cards, we have made a donation to the Nelson Mandela Foundation to help build schools for needy children.
My 150 colleagues and I look forward to joining forces with you in the New Year, in the spirit of entrepreneurship in the global public interest, to ""improve the state of the world.""
My very best wishes accompany you in your contemplation at the end of the year and particularly for a healthy and successful 2002.

All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.
When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.
The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.
New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period.
Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels.
This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.

Wright was very critical of how the Governor is handling the issue and wants  to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the Governor to get on  board.
Wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to  consider (Dave's typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later  today) One of Wright's key concern is forward contracting.
The utilities said that Loretta Lynch is the problem with the onerous  ""prudence"" criteria she's imposing on utility forward contracts.
Those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting.
Much discussion of what California does on the gas side,  i.e., set an  objective benchmark price; if the utility beats it, they profit; if they do  worse, they take the hit.
The utility, under this framework, has broad  flexibility to contract forward, i.e., PUC gets out of the way.

We have narrowed our choice of vehicles to two minivans: a Toyota Sienna and a Chrysler Town & Country.
Surprisingly, Ben helped us eliminate SUV's from consideration.
He prefers the smoother ride of the minivan.
It will be better for taking long trips.
The down side is he doesn't want to be seen driving a minivan once he turns 16.
Ha!
: )   We were able to help satisfy Anna (and Ben) by choosing a higher-end minivan that has many ""bells and whistles"" on it, yet still costs less than an SUV.
We are leaning toward the Toyota, even though it is a bit smaller than the Chrysler, because of its reliability and how it holds its resale value.
The Toyota dealer also has ""$300 over invoice"" sale on currently.
Plus they told Mark there will be additional financing incentives starting this Saturday.
Both the Toyota and Chrysler dealers have vehicles in inventory we can choose from.
So, we hope to close the deal with the Toyota dealer this coming Saturday.

AD Time:  New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
This rule greatly enhances an insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.

564,"Mark Haedicke, Greg Whalley and I will be meeting with several people at the  NYMEX on Friday morning.
It's possible (although not likely) that Dan  Rappaport will attend one of the meetings.
I remember that we were very  unhappy with his testimony earlier this year and I know we delivered that  message to the NYMEX a couple of times.
What I'm not sure of is whether  their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings.
Are you aware  of the content of the NYMEX testimony at those hearings and whether or not  our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared?
I'm just  wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if  Rappaport does attend - either positive or negative.
I also heard just a few minutes ago that Mark H. had cancelled our trip to DC  currently scheduled for 12/16 since he will be meeting with Commissioner  Newsome tomorrow.
It might make sense to leave the December meeting on the  calendar, though.
Seems to me the Enron message may get lost in the overall  background noise of a big ISDA meeting.
Maybe I can come up alone and we can  do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo  time in the Commissioner's face.
What do you think?

570,"Dear Mr. Lay ,                     I was employed as an EGLI employee twelve years ago and currently I am a contractor with EES power company .
My wife has been                     with ENRON for fifteen years eversince she came out of U of H .
Our hearts bleed ENRON blood and they were wounded deeply last                     Friday night when we saw you on TV announcing the sale of ENRON to Dynergy .
We are and still very grateful to all the good things                      that ENRON has provided to our family ( we have three children) and feel so blessed to be associated with such a caring and generous                     company .
Mr Lay , we love you , respect you and most of all we trust you to do everything in your power to help to save ENRON and in process                      all of its employees .
Our hearts were broken when we saw your face in that Friday announcement .
The stress of giving up ""your child""                      away can be devastated and I think you have aged greatly the last three weeks or so .
The stress impact was almost the same as that                       which I saw on Mr .
Michael Cappellas as he announced the sale of Compaq to HP sometimes ago .
Please beleive us we felt this way                       whether you gave back the 60 millions or not .
( I felt you deserve the money because under your leadership ENRON has growthed                        tremendously the last fifteen years or so and hence all the people here including the critics have the jobs that they currently have and                         99.99 % of them would have taken the money anyway besides that what are the reasonable compensation to a leader that have tripled                        or quadrupled shareholders values ?.
Look at Michael Eisner , Larry Orvitz and dozen other Fortune 500 CEO 's compensation including                         those that have not added any values to their respective companies during their tenure and they will see your compensation are justified .
Throughout the years we saw so many changes at ENRON and most disturbing fact is the expenses ( G & A ,outside contractors ,consultant ...)                        go up thru the roof .
Since I am a contractor  I knew how much ENRON paid for such services , me and my wife were trying to do our parts by she                        wrote and sent an e-mail to Mr Rick Causey suggesting ways to cut down outside contractor 's cost because whatever the savings will be                        reflected directly to the bottom lines .
Mr Lay , whatever happened we will allways trust you to steer ENRON into the right path and we truly wish you Health ,Prosperity and                         Happiness to you and your family .
Thank you for reading this e-mail .

Enron  should make no severance or other payments to Andrew Fastow without first  bringing the matter to the Special Committee and obtaining its consent.

597,"We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.
In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.
The gov.
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas.
He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared.
Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration.
The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.
His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.
He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level.
He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW).
He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided).
He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases.
As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of  generation plants.
The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.
This  was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear

Enron fires two employees linked to partnerships      NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. <ENE.N>, the embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by U.S. regulators.
Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan, managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division.
Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with Enron.
Shares of Enron were trading down 5 cents or .55 percent at $9 on the New York Stock Exchange.

608,"Rick,  I have spent some time reviewing the allocation of PGE's VaR and net open position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to better match the limits and their objectives to PGE's trading activity and portfolio.
I have discussed these changes with Rod Hayslett and he has concurred with my proposal.
I have also reviewed them with Vlady .
1.
VaR:  Given that PGE is a naturally short utility and does not hedge its long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons, I propose that PGE reallocate $500k of its regulated electric VaR to its regulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR to $7.5mm.
This change is necessary to account for the size of PGE's natural short position in the back-end of its reporting period.
After reducing PGE's electric VaR it will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated electric portfolio.
2.
NOP:  After changing PGE's regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary to change the corresponding net open position.
Currently PGE has been using a 10 Bcf limit for its NOP and Maturity Gap.
Using a $2.5MM VaR I've recalculated  the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.
If you agree with these changes please let me know.
If you have any questions please contact me at (503) 464-2723.

With the markets short-term overbought, investors should not be surprised if negative corporate news takes its toll on stocks over the next month.
As we have mentioned, the corporate confession period is a great time for companies to lower expectations.
However, investors need to be focused on the big picture.
The Federal Reserve is strongly on the side of the investor.
Additionally, with successful passage of the tax bill through Congress, the Treasury Department will be mailing refund checks to taxpayers, as the tax-cut is retroactive to January of this year.
We believe the economy will respond positively to this 'twin pronged' stimulation.
Investors should take advantage of any weakness in their favorite stocks.

636,"In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001.
Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website.
A summary of these changes is listed below.
Stack Manager Changes  Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price.
Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.
Orders will be queued by price and time stamp.
When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.
In order to turn on this functionality select the "" Allowed Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.
If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected.
Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.
Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price.
Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.
Orders will be queued by price and time stamp.
When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.
In order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.
If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected.
If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the ""Restricted Top of Stack"" feature.
Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager.
In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title.
A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear.
Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter.
To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" All"" option from the drop down box.
Website Changes  New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.
In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box.
Price of Limit Orders   Modify Limit Orders  Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order.
In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the ""Today's Orders"" section.
The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product.
Once the price is at the desired level click the ""Set"" button and the price will be modified.
Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.
You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.
Expiration time for Limit Orders Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days.
Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.
Float the Today's Orders Section You can now float the "" Limit Order "" section.
In order to do so, right click in the ""Today's Orders "" section and select the float window option.
In order to make the window "" Stay On Top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.
Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products.
In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.
Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit.
For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin.
The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.
In order to be set up to use this functionality.
Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.
Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted.
First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID.
Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days.
These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.
Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001.
The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.
Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.
If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

I'm  looking forward to the cooler weather.
I got some good bargains on post  winter sweaters this weekend because no one in Houston is even thinking about  buying a sweater!
I spent more money on clothes than I ever have at one  sitting!
My backyard is really looking good.
It's almost all planted, maybe 90%  done.
I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer  Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms).
It will be a  while before they look like trees, though.
Right now they kinda look like  tall bushes.
I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft.  plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little  little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about  7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm.
They're in pots, because I'll have  to take them in during hard freezed.
I've planted lots of climbing pink,  yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid.
It will take a while before  they fill out.
Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot  of color.
Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over  Houston.
I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds  and butterflies.
I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a  bit.
Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit.
I need a little sun to make them bloom.
And then there's my St. Francis  fountain.
He's just lovely!

The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com.
We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname).
Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format.
It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com.
For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards.
If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks.
Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format.

He had been feeling bad for about a month and last week he passed out and hurt himself.
At the hospital they found out that he had a bleeding ulcer that made him faint.
They took had to take him off the blood thinners and they were giving him medication for the ulcer and sent him home Tuesday night.
Wednesday morning he must have had a blood clot that caused a heart attack.
Crystal and Jamie did cpr which started his heart again but then it stopped.
Michael is in Denver and is going to Alamo tonight for the funeral on Saturday.
The kids and I aren't going since Michael has to leave for Denver and then North Dakota on Sunday and he doesn't want me trying to drive out there alone with the kids.
Michael was training on Wednesday so I waited to tell him until lunch.
He is blessed that two of his good friends were there and they have helped him deal with his loss (one of them is exactly Michael's age and is dying of lymphoma...he has 5 children, the youngest just 7).
Michael seems to be doing fine, although the funeral will be hard.
His family will be in a financial crisis, though.
Please pray with us for them that God helps them through their pain and hard decisions.

666,"As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.
We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.
Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.
In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.
Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.
In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.
It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.
To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.
If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

667,"DTI have reached a 637 settlement with it's customers, they have filed with FERC for approval, the first pipeline to reach a settlement.
The settlement includes the netting and trading of imbalances, intraday recalls on released capacity, and other GISB mandates that took years to implement but in reality have no application to the industry.
Liquidity has increased on the system, TTT volumes have increased from 3 Bcf/d to 5 Bcf/d over the last year with a 5:1 ration of physical to traded volumes.
The interconnect with Empire @ Lysander currently flowing 30-60,000dt/d has a maximum capability of 100,000dt/d.
Empire is now allowing secondary deliveries to Lysander therefore volumes have increased at the location.
Note:  Empire recently bought out by Union from ANR.
DTI have an new pipeline project called Green brier.
A new company will be started that will consist of DTI as part owners and operators and other equity interests.
The new pipeline will flow 600,000 dt/d from Cornwell (interconnect with Tennessee and DTI) and run down through VA, into Granville County, NC.
DTI are offering winter only (30cents) and summer only (13cents) service, the project is designed to compete with Transco's Momentum expansion into Zn4.
DTI have remarketed all the 55 Bcf of GSS that was turned back over the past year and also reconstructed for 90% of the 2.2 Bcf/d of transport.
Another project they are looking to release to the market is an expansion of deliveries to Leidy in conjunction with Marketlink.
DTI have a current transportation offering, Lebanon to Leidy capacity 29,100dt/d, for one year starting 11/1/01.
DTI are looking and will probably get max rates (approximately 30 cents).
DTI will be increasing the transportation fuel rates from 2.28% to 2.78% as per a TCRA settlement recently agreed to by it's customers.
The net effect of this will be a small reduction in the delivered quantity at the delivery locations and a small amount of stranded receipt point capacity on peak days.
This news has not been released to the market, I'm not sure when this will take effect.

""The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is  something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort,"" but the  ""precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword,"" warned  Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision.
Although  she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC  ""should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action.""
Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action  expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the  ""extraordinary regulatory treatment"" that the Commission gave it.
Critics  claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler  Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she  noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas.
""...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in  the California marketplace.
This makes it difficult to understand just how  our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing  electric generation in California this summer,"" Breathitt said.
If anything,  she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even  worse than it is.
There should have been a ""fuller airing of this issue"" at FERC before the  project was certificated, she noted.
""It would be counterproductive for this  Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without  ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more

711,"This has been a tough couple of weeks.
I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.
Here's a rundown of events from last week:  	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.
Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.
We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.
The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.
As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.
Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.
Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.
All agency ratings are investment grade.
Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:  	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.
Transaction counts remain higher than average.
EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.
EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.
Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.
We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.
We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.
And that's where you come in.
Look around you.
Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.
That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.
Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

714,"As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.
We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.
Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.
In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.
Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.
In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.
It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.
To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.
If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

716,"Dear Family,  Please see the attached schedules for preseason and regular games for the Houston Rockets through November.
Because we all have very busy lives and find it impossible to confirm too far in advance, I will wait closer to each game before distributing tickets.
Also, Ken's schedule is a moving target and it would make it much easier for him to squeeze in at least one game this year, if we could do it on shorter notice.
Our eight basketball seats are amazing and the tickets are a hot item, so hopefully everyone will try to make this work and have fun doing it.
I will wait at least seven days before each game to distribute the tickets.
If you have any interest in pre-selecting certain games that you definitely want to attend, please advise me and I will put your name on the list with an * next to it.
Additionally, if you think you know your schedule and would like to be considered in the ticket distribution for certain games, I will put your name on the list with a ?
next to your name.
Once your name is on the list and as each game gets closer, I would appreciate it if you would contact me ASAP when you find out that you are unable to attend.
Everyone has said that they want to be fair and rotate, so that each family member has a shot at attending a game and getting both kinds of tickets.
Hopefully, we can all work it out.
However, in the event that we have more requests than tickets for the same game, and we are unable to settle it, I will have Barb pull names out of a hat.
Once you confirm your attendance, tickets can be put in an envelope with your name on them and sent down to the doorman at the Huntingdon for you to pick up.
For any games where our immediate family is not able to use the tickets, they will be distributed to other lucky recipients in a rotating order.
I will have Barb draw your names and ours out of a hat to create the rotation.
If you have other family members or someone special that you would like to offer tickets to, let me know.
I can either contact you and have you contact them or you can give me their names and contact information and Barb will contact them directly, as you wish.
In the event that I am traveling or cannot be reached, please contact Barb as she will be copied in on all current schedules and have access to the tickets.

723,"Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.
This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.
In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.
We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.
Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.
We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.
In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.
For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.
In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.
This quarter they are reported separately.
Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.
Following are the highlights of our businesses:  Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.
Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.
Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.
While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.
Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.
So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.
Transportation and Distribution: 	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.
This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.
Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.
This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.
Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.
Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.
This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.
Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions.
This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.
In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.
Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.
These charges include: ?
A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp. ?
$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.
This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?
$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.
With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

We are presently working on  a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly  improve communication flow and responsiveness.
However in this regard we also  need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA   regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.
In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your  groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's  in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team  Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233)  or myself.
It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our  A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this  regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you  may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A  resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.
In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you  to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters.

We want to encourage you to come to work.
We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.
Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.
I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.
But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.
I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.
Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing.
For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.
We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.
Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.
I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.
I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.
While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.
We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.
We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.
We will share more information on these efforts soon.

Here are some high points:  FERC issues an order rejecting the proposed amendment to the CAISO creditworthiness provisions, and granting in part the complaint of the generators in the docket (which we supported).
The CAISO is ordered to enforce the existing creditworthiness provisions of its tariff and invoice CDWR for transactions with the non-creditworthy IOUs, within 15 days.
Otherwise, FERC will seek injunctive relief in court to enforce its order.
Also, a creditworthy party must be provided and bills paid, otherwise, the must offer requirement will be suspended (applies to California).
Commissioner Massey dissented on the suspension of the must offer requirement.
Wood indicated that he supported the order as written and quipped that ""the ISO must now do what we told them to do the 3rd time!""
The remaining Commissioners voted in favor.
Unanimous vote on a 6-page order which establishes the FERC ""business plan"" on how it will move forward on RTO's, electricity market design and structure, so that faster progress can be made.
Watch for a future order relaxing the FERC's ex parte rules to facilitate communication between FERC and state commissioners.
The idea is that communications will be more freely made and that a transcript of the communication will be filed in the record of the proceeding to comply with due process and other legal requirements.
I gathered the above from the discussions held at the meeting as the draft orders are not yet available.
We will review them upon receipt, and update this e-mail if necessary.

We met briefly at the April technology program, which by the way, was fascinating.
I   read in the Houston Business Journal of the San Francisco pie incident and thought your follow-through on the speech was perfect.
Look at the bright side, you're in great company!
I'm writing to solicit your advice on how my business can best capitalize on the ever-changing energy business.
As some background information, I'm responsible for a group of companies that are primarily in the businesses of manufacturing, personalizing and mailing laser printed billing statements and credit cards.
Personix is an industry leader in the markets we serve and Enron is a larger user of the types of services our company provides.
At the present time, we do not do business with Enron.
I've read where Enron has established an electricity retailing operation in anticipation of the Texas electricity market deregulation.
We would like to discuss with the appropriate person in your organization how our billing statement solutions may be of interest to Enron for your various energy and broadband businesses.
I would appreciate it if you could pass our name along in order to advance these discussions.
Thanks and look forward to seeing you at the next YPO event.

It can, however, lighten our burden as we help others.
After much thought, we have decided to go forward with our Enron Elves Event.
In partnership with the Salvation Army, we have adopted three underprivileged families.
Enron Elves is an opportunity to provide gifts for children who would otherwise go without.
The official Enron Elves Tree has been erected and will soon be adorned with holiday gift tags.
Each gift tag contains a gift idea for a child.
If you would like to participate in Enron Elves, here's what you do: ?
Take a candy cane gift tag from the tree ?
Sign your name to one side of the folded gift tag and place the signed tag in the box by the tree  ?
The other gift tag needs to come back attached to the wrapped gift  ?
Bring the wrapped gift and place it under the tree  All gifts need to be wrapped and under the tree by December 18.
We will then hold a prize drawing, including Blazer Basketball tickets, for those employees who participated.
Thank you for considering those in need during this holiday season.

Daniel is the person in charge of the lunches, and he has not had an opportunity to prepare the monthly spreadsheets for August and September, which show the total amounts per day, and how much each cost center is charged.
He's come up with a percentage, according to how many total people he orders for, then according to how many people are in each group, and he charges each cost center accordingly.
I've attached the 2 worksheets that he's provided me, which are for June and July, however there were fewer people in our group because since then he has added Brian Redmond and his group to our budget.
Daniel is working on preparing the spreadsheets for August and September.
I've told Ina that I'm needing them for a project for you, so I'm sure that they will be ready soon.
I thought that I could just look at what's been charged to our cost center each month, but it was too difficult to figure out which invoices were from which lunch because they don't always hit the cost center the month during or after they were invoiced.
They are also sometimes charged on a credit card and then billed in a huge lump sum.
I've simply made a spreadsheet showing selected restaurants and the average price of what we've been charged for June and July, and then I've shown what it will cost for 15 people to eat if we order it separately.
I've included tips and delivery charges, since we're billed for those as well.

One of our ""old friends"", the 1line Williams site, is definately the cause for the Northwest, Kern and Transco misses.
This site still appears to be having problems, so it should be checked for the next couple of days.
When trying to go to it tonight, I received various errors, and the general site layout appeared different since the last time I looked (this means they could potentially change the layout of the page we get data from as well).
As I write this, ""capture"" jobs for Kern, Northwest, and Transco are failing due to ""Internal Server Errors"".
Hopefully, this is a short-term problem, and these sites will stabilize soon.

In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.
We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.
To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.
We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.
In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.
Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.
We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.

I       hope you're keeping your legendary sense of perspective.
One of the       things I have admired about you is that you never lose sight of the       fact that people make an organization successful, a lesson many of       your Enron peers apparently have yet to learn.
Maybe it comes from       having priorities other than making money ot being powerful, but my       conversations with friends demonstrates that they still appreciate       your loyalty to your staff.
Philadelphia agrees very well with Michael and me.
We're getting       ensconced in our house and adjusting to life in the 'burbs.

I've seen Mike Terrasso at some of the EHS       meetings - what a thoughtful, gentle man.
Although I miss some of the excitement and intellectual stimulation of       working at Enron, I don't miss Houston (except for the people).
However, I'm energized by the notion of incorporating EHS excellence       into a coherent management system that focuses on improving the bottom       line, and I'm enjoying the challenge of managing a large staff again.
Given all of the recent consolidation in the refining industry, I'm       thankful for Sunoco's strong perfromance over the past couple of years       and hope that we can remain independent for a few more years.

Cecille Cabacungan from GSPP suggested that I contact you.
Currently, I am with Mercer Management Consulting, a strategy consulting firm.
While I enjoy my work with Mercer, the timing of transfers to our San Francisco office is uncertain.
Mercer, however, has two programs through which I could move to the Bay area.
The first is an externship program through which I could consult to a company for 6 - 12 months, or longer.
As my attached resume reflects, I have several years of experience developing business plans and assessing market conditions.
The second is a fellowship program through which I could consult to a non-profit organization for up to 12 months at a small fraction of Mercer's standard fees.
I am particularly interested in organizations that work on economic development issues, but would be happy to help a range of organizations develop and implement their long-term strategic goals.
Specific types of work I could perform include:  *	Assessing market size and growth opportunities, e.g., utility/profitability of new services or products *	Managing co-operative efforts with other institutions, e.g., pooling resources to increase leverage and efficiency of operations *	Benchmarking and redistributing resources to focus on highest impact areas  I would like to learn whether you think Enron could benefit from my services or know of a corporation or non-profit that could.

809,"From time to time there have been discussions in the TIE list criticizing Con Edison for its involvement in out-of-merit actions, implying that it is inappropriate for Con Edison control room operators to make such requests.
In its recent order on the Revised Local Mitigation Measures, FERC, in response to allegations made by Orion, ordered the NYISO to take responsibility for out-of-merit.
The Con Edison system has the world's most concentrated use of energy for residential and commercial purposes.
It is also a highly transmission-constrained area where transfer limitations under normal and second contingency conditions require certain minimum generation levels within specific load pockets to assure reliability under existing reliability rules.
One of the main functions of the Con Edison control center is to be vigilant of system conditions at all times and prevent the system from reaching an unreliable operating state.
When such conditions are imminent, the Con Edison operator so advises the NYISO.
Some parties have said that Con Edison operators should never make out-of-merit requests.
Con Edison operators would be acting irresponsibly if they were to detect an imminent unreliable operating condition and just sit back and not inform the NYISO of the potential danger.
Con Edison operators have been trained to focus on operating the New York City system.
The NYISO operators have a much wider state-wide focus.
It is entirely appropriate for both a transmission owner (TO) and NYISO operators to work cooperatively in maintaining reliability with the clear understanding that under the FERC-approved tariff, it is the NYISO that has sole responsibility for reliability.
I would like to clarify that all involvement by Con Edison operators in out-of-merit actions are based on the following  FERC-approved process in which the NYISO, and not the TO operator, has sole responsibility for these actions.
The NYISO FERC Electric Tariff, Section 5.4,  Operations Under Adverse Conditions states in essence that: 		*	The NYISO shall operate the system in accordance with Reliability Rules, including local rules 		*	The NYISO will do this, among other measures, by adjusting generator output levels 		*	The NYISO has sole responsibility for declaring that Adverse Conditions are imminent 		*	Activation of these actions shall involve a two-step process 			1.
The TO involved will advise the NYISO that an Adverse Condition is imminent and recommend action 			2.
The NYISO activates the appropriate procedures 		*	Records of the activation of such procedures shall be maintained by both the TO and the NYISO  Having stated the above, let me also say that Con Edison has been working with NYISO operations to minimize the occurrences of conditions that require Con Edison operators to request actions that result in OOM operations.
Con Edison supports current efforts by the NYISO to manage load pocket reliability events in a way that SCD can be used to maintain reliability with in-merit generation.
In effect, the FERC recent order does not require any change from present practice which is, and has always been, in compliance with Section 5.4 of the NYISO FERC Electric Tariff, and in compliance with FERC's recent order: the NYISO is solely responsible for out-of-merit actions.

810,"Hey guys!
It's been a long time, I hope everyone is doing well especially since I know it's the end of bid week and it's Friday.
Just thought you might enjoy some of the things I've learned since I've been here about the English language.
Hopefully they'll give you chuckle.
There are differences between British English and American English that I've noticed so far:  Pants are ""trousers.""
Don't make the mistake that I did:   I wrote, ""Black Pants, Brown Pants, Khaki Pants"" on my dry cleaning inventory to turn into the dry cleaners and got reminded that I was turning in ""trousers"" not pants with a smirk.
""Pants"" are what they call underwear here.
Also, I almost fell over in my chair laughing one day when a girl in my group said ""PANTS!""
and hit her hand on the desk when her computer crashed.
Apparentely, it's the equivalent of saying ""CRAP!""
I went to the grocery store around the block and I was looking to buy some orange juice.
On the outside of some of the containers it said ""with extra bits"" and some said ""no bits.""
I was puzzled until my boyfriend explained that it was ""with pulp"" or ""without pulp.""
When I go to restaurants I have to remember that fries are ""chips"" on the menu (even at McDonalds), and chips are called ""crisps.""
If you want to get a baked potato it's called a ""jacket potato.""
And if you want mashed potatoes, just say ""mash.""
One of the favorite dishes at the pubs (not bars) here is ""bangers and mash"" which translates to sausages links and mashed potatoes.
Here are a few more of the oddities:  You don't stand in line here, you ""stand in queue.""
Trash cans are ""bins.""
It's amusing to hear someone say, ""I don't want it- just bin it.""
Country boy or redneck types are called ""wide boys"" or ""barrow boys.""
When you spell things out loud, Z is pronounced ""zed"" and H is pronounced ""haitch.""
Cross walks are ""zebra crossings""  since they are signified by white stripes on the road.

She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.
Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel.
Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.
Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.
Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.
Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant.
Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.
I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.
To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.
Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.
Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.
After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.
Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.
I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.

FERC staff proposes to have 6 weeks of meetings (up to 3 days per week) to discuss issues identified by the participants.
The purpose of the meetings is to try to develop consensus among industry participants on a standard interconnection agreement and procedures.
A list of issues is attached.
This list was developed by EPSA and presented to FERC at last week's meeting.
At this week's meeting, the discussion will focus on the scope of interconnection rights and on interconnection study issues.
Donna Fulton will attend these meetings on behalf of Enron.
In preparation for the meetings, EPSA developed a position paper, which is attached.
Briefly, EPSA proposes:       - Interconnecting Generator may elect, as part of its application for interconnection and study agreement, to be studied as an Energy Resource and/or as a Network/Capacity Resource; it may also request an ""optional deliverability"" study based on case-specific requirements.
The interconnecting generator may elect its level of interconnection following completion of the studies.
- The rights of the interconnected generator will depend on the manner it is studied, the upgrades for which the generator has paid, and whether the transmission pricing system is based on physical rights or financial rights.

I've attached the instructional worksheet Bill sent out awhile ago - it is actually a very coherent rendering of the intricacies involved in entering these enigmatic deals.
(Read: Inter-desk swaps are not real easy to understand.
This worksheet is.)
One tip: If STCA is long or short going into the Real Time market, they will have entered a purchase from or sale to the California Imbalance as a sort of ""place holder.""
An offsetting purchase or sale will need to be made under the STCA book in order to complete the deal and keep STCA flat.
If you're feeling ambitious and want to see the direct effects of putting deals in under the wrong book, run a Forward Obligation report (in Enpower Reports under the Risk tab) for the day, desk, and region in question.
If you did everything correctly, the report should produce nothing but zeroes.

He has been working up there for  the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our  weather derivatives team about a year ago.
She hopes to continue to work for  Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I  can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York  office.
It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn  could be someone for you to consider.
She came originally from the London  office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some  feedback on her.
In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very  early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.
She came to  Houston and  has done a number of different things.
I think that she is well  organized and control minded.
Understands Enron's business.
Managing a  group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.
I am not sure that  people enjoy working under her.
That could be old news, however.
There are  a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her  based on very recent experience.
Do you know of her?
Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.
She would  definitely represent an Enron point of view.
They have two small daughters -  she might be interested in something part time even.
Could mean lower cost  that way.

I have worked for Enron for the last 10 years and I can say that despite what has happened today, joining Enron was the best career move I made.
The past 10 years have presented opportunities that were beyond my wildest dreams.
I appreciate everything that Enron has done for myself and my family, and I leave believing that I did my best to return my gratefulness in some way.
While growing up in a worling class environment my father taught me two great lessons in life, which I believe we all need to learn.
The first being that if you ever want anything in life then you had better work for it.
The second being that you should never understand the meaning of the word ""can't"".
I believe that I have been able to follow his teaching in my career with Enron.
I leave Enron with tremendous experience and, most of all a feeling of belonging to something that was once great.
I truly believed in the company and its people.
Indeed I have reminded myself daily over the last few weeks that Enrons success was built more on its intangible assets rather than its tangible assets.
Enron's greatness was built by its people because we all have dreams and ambitions to be a part of something great.
Although I leave the company with great sadness I also leave with a great feeling of thanks and appreciation.

855,"Thank you for taking time to come to our Gas Logistics Staff meeting on Tuesday.
My apologies to those individuals that were inadvertently dropped from the email distribution.
I will schedule time to visit with anyone that missed the staff meeting.
I know that you are all still searching for answers to the Enron events of the last few weeks.
You asked lots of good questions at the meeting.
At the bottom of this email are responses to a few additional questions.
As I said at the meeting, while I am discouraged by recent events, I am really proud of ETS and of our Gas Logistics Team and I am looking forward to showing off our pipeline successes to the Dynegy management team in the future.
With the Thanksgiving holiday just around the corner, I'd like to take the opportunity to wish you and your family a safe and happy holiday season.
I hope that you can spend time with your families and friends away from the demands of work.
I'd also like to put two dates on your calendar to celebrate work accomplishments with our team.

858,"Russell: I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.
Bill  Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.
He is an  extremely creative individual.
Whalley actually commented on him today as  someone ""who thinks outside the box"".
Bill actually sat in a bar four years  and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.
He has been  successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.
As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.
He throws out  ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.
He pointed  out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally  don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for  Enron.
In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within  reason.
I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be  considered a high priority.
I am willing to accept some of the credit risk  exposure as a cost of doing business.
Bill understands his role as an  independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for  someone with finite capital.
I place very high confidence in Bill not  conducting high risk trades.
Having said that, we certainly need to monitor  his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.
Just understand that he is  at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade  counterparty.
I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread  option he traded.
He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the  trading desk, knew it as well.
There are a couple isolated products that  Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.
This  was one product.
Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing  models created by the research group.
The problem with these models is that  they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental  price limitations.
For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible,  for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within  variable cost than the models predict.
Thus it is necessary to apply a  correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.
Obviously,  we have this function in our pricing models.
I was not aware this  methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.
This has since  been changed.
Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very  few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.
Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to  Enron.
I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting  credit.
I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade  considering the circumstances.
If you believe differently, please advise.
Thanks,

1.
You probably know about it already.
ABHAY MEHTA, the author of ""Power  Play"", is on a tour of the United States.
Please, take a look at the information about a  meeting last Sunday  at Stanford University.
The web site address is  given below.
My wife went to the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron.
About 40  people attended.
2.
I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to  write jointly an academic paper on Enron for a financial journal.
He wanted to work on an  article on EBS.
I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company  Reinventing Itself.
I made a few points to John:  a. Enron's evolution did not just happen  by accident.
It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching strategy developed by the management.
b.
In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment.
I came up  with a term ""proactive evolution"", as opposed to ""reactive evolution.""
c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee empowerment.
d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and  accomplishemnts.
The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate  strategy and would help greatly our recruiting efforts.
Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key  players.
Let me know what you thing about it.
John is really excited about this paper.

I used to be proud of Enron.
I believed everything that you and EES management said.
I believe that the Vision and Values that you and other senior executives at Enron preached are not worth the paper they are printed on.
Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence.
I don't believe you respected the rights of so many Enron employees who sacrificed their family time so that the company would succeed.
I don't believe you have any integrity when it comes to fully disclosing Enron's future.
You obviously have not communicated the truth to employees, analysts or anyone else.
Maybe you should look inside yourself to see if you have the excellence now that you demanded from your employees.
I would like to see you take ownership of the incredible debacle that has fallen upon Enron.
So many of my friends and colleagues are out of work because of the gross mismanagement that you and others have shown.
I believe the least you could do is go on record and address these people at a time of year that is so special to so many.

874,"Listened in on the analyst call this morning.
Here are my notes.
Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.
The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.
Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.
Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.
Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.
Specific points: EES will be a part of the new company.
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.
If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.
If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.
Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.
Osprey will be unwound late next summer.
Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.
However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.
EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.
The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.
Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.
They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.
Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling.

In addition Enron has a very young and mobile workforce = that provides great flexibility and energy to our efforts.

However at the end of the day th= e business requires a level of maturity and experience that very effectivel= y complements this young and very talented workforce.

Will there be a second set of documents for the LLC getting the  transformer as well as the turbine?
2.
Tax liability - I think we should broaden the tax section to offload  responsibility for taxes related to the transfer and ownership of the  equipment, not just the sale.
I believe this should be a TEH responsibility.
3.
Terminology - Breakout contract should be Facility Agreement, and  commercial operations should be as defined in the Facility Agreement (a  reference is fine).
4.
Confidentiality - any reason not to have them agree to be bound by the  confidentiality provisions in the facility agreement?
If fact, please review  the confidentiality provisions in the GE agreement so that we can discuss  same.
5.
Creditworthiness - looks like we may have an issue here.
We should  specifiy that the note should be from a credit worthy entity, or guaranteed  by a credit worthy entity.
6.
Timing of delivery of contract and funding -  in discussing this matter  with our commercial lead, Ben Jacoby, he indicated that he believed that the  obligation to fund would be contemporaneous with the delivery of the facility  agreement, or stated another way, a condition precedent to the obligation to  fund as opposed to existing (as a signed document) as of the time of signing.
7.
Reps - as we discussed, Enron should rep that it has the ability to  convey the equipment, or other such language, as opposed to getting into the  nitty gritty of our financing structure.
I'm still reviewing and collecting comments, but this gives you an idea of  where we are headed.

Otherwise it will cause aggregation errors in our reports, values with the same DRN_description within a pipeline are all summed  together.
I have created a query called qry_Mulri_DRN_Names in the Access database O:\Fundy_ops\ReportSetting.mdb (Access 2000), You can run this query to find out how many duplicates there are, and which pipeline they are.
If you entered those duplicates, you can work with Hyde or Eddie to have them corrected.
Please also pay special attention when you enter new DRN and their  descriptions.
The rule is No Duplicate DRN or DRN descriptions are allowed within the same pipeline.
When in doubt, you can always run the query mentioned above to check duplicates.

Ashcroft said the information received was not specific as to target or date of attack, but was of sufficient credibility  to warrant sharing with the public.
He further called on law enforcement agencies, citizens and U.S. interests abroad to be on ""highest alert.""
Although no specific targets were mentioned, various federal agencies, including DOE, EPA, FAA, FBI and DOT have been alerted.
Effective immediately, and until further notice, DOE and NNSA have mandated that all activities shall add measures to their current heightened state of readiness designed to deter terrorist attacks by visibly increased perimeter security and security checks.
Changes in routines, including institution of random measures, shall also be implemented.
DOE and NNSA strongly suggest that the energy industry also implement these actions and to be on alert for any suspicious activities.

949,"As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.
Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.
This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.
The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.
Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.
Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.
From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.
Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.
We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.
Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.
This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.
By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO.""
This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.
Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.
We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.
It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.
The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.
We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.
As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.
This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.
We will update you periodically on our process.
Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.
Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.
Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.
Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.
In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.
Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.
In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.
Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.
Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.
As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.
Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:  Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman  Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.
We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.
Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.
We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.
We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

965,"On December 21, 2000,  I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for gas  flow on  December 22-26, 2000.
The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of  $15.76.
This price was increased to $16.00 to encompass trades transacted  via the telephone.
The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:  Nicor Gas Company was closed for  their company holiday on Friday, December  22nd.
As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for  the December  22-26 time period.
Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December  22-26 time period.
Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December  22nd (even though they were closed)  for the December 23-26 time period,  which resulted in a $13.88 posting for the December 23-26th period.
I  received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing  concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal  activity that transacted on December 22nd.
While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online,  from time-to-time, there will be significant volumes transacted over the  telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.

966,"We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.
To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST).
It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.
Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:  Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week  Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:  Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems  Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products.
Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation.
Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties.
Credit limits, etc.
will be tested during the simulation.
Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.
Next steps   Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles.
You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.
Summary  This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business.
We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.
If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Some friends of mine bought a weekend there at a  silent auction at a charity event recently and their brochure looked great.
The website has pictures, prices, activities at the resort, and a hyperlink  to the Website for the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce which lists the  activities going on in Santa Fe.
I think you are going to be too late for  their summer opera series, but I took a look and there appears to be other  fun things going on.

969,"Mr. Lay:  First, I want to say that I've been a dedicated employee of Enron for 9 yea= rs now and, looking back over that time, it's been the greatest period of m= y life, career-wise.
When I first went to work for Enron, I was almost sta= rry eyed.
I was working for the home town team and it was just the greates= t company I had ever been associated with.
I started out with Enron Power = Corp. and the energy and focus within that group was just incredible.
I've seen a lot of change over the past 9 years.
Some great, some good and=  some not so good.
But all in all, I would do it all over again in a heart=  beat, because I still trust in the core of this company and decisions our = management have made.
But most of all, we've still got great people.
Base= d on the current events of the past 3 to 6 months, it does indeed look like=  we are going to have to ""do it all over again"".
However, I am an eternal = optimist.
Looking at this in football terms...  this is a rebuilding year = and we've got a bright future with a young team and a deep bench.
One thing I always hung my hat on was the integrity that both you and Rich = Kinder exuded.
I was saddened to see Mr. Kinder move on, but I was confide= nt that having you remain behind would continue our successes.
And we have=  been successful.
Aside from the LJM issue (which, to be honest, I still d= on't fully understand), I think we've just had some external distractions t= hat have hampered our stock growth this year, such as Dabhol, Portland Gene= ral, California, etc., in addition to the market conditions in general.
=20  In the all-employee meeting, you told the troops that it was going to take = the continued dedication and hard work from all of us to get things going i= n the right direction in order for us to dig out from this mess.
I am full= y prepared to do this, however, there is one request I would like to bring = up.
I know I am not the only person out there who has options that are goi= ng to expire at the end of this year.
In all my wildest dreams (or nightma= res), I would have never envisioned the stock getting low enough to threate= n a grant price of $21.563, but here we are.
As a dedicated and confident = employee, I hung in there early in the year and listened to all indications=  around me that the stock would go to 100.
Later in the year, as the stock=  moved downward, I heard indications that we were going to bounce back stro= ng.
I was on board.
I was excited.
I trusted that this was the case.
In=  fact, I look back on this past year and, based on what I knew at the time,=  I would probably do the same thing over again.
But...   that was then and this is now.
It has been painful for me, as I k= now it has been for you and all others with a stake in this company.
I wan= t to get us back to our heyday and am willing to commit to that end.
=20  My request is simple...    is there any way possible to extend options expi= ring at the end of this year by one year?
If you want to make a good faith gesture towards long-time employees who ar= e willing to re-dedicate themselves to the daunting task at hand, I can thi= nk of nothing better for the short term.
I think extending the expiration=  date on options would go a long way towards healing an Enron employee popu= lation who need some good news in the midst of this situation we find ourse= lves in.
=20  If you can't do anything, I will understand.
I know your office has always=  had an open door policy with respect to e-mail feedback, but this is the f= irst one I've ever written.
I always contend that it never hurts to ask in=  a situation like this.

Let me know if you  disagree.
While a commodity forward contract which contains an asymmetrical default  provision clearly does not have the characteristic of net settlement, we do  not believe that Statement 133 is appropriately applied to any contract which  requires the making and taking of delivery of a physical commodity absent a  default, regardless of whether the default results in a termination payment  which may be payable to the defaulting party.
An event of default and  resulting termination of a commodity contract can have far reaching negative  implications for the defaulting party well beyond the terms of the contract  itself (e.g.
damage to reputation and credit, triggering of cross-defaults,  etc.
).

978,"Hello Everyone,   	This week again saw some upsets, both in college and pro games, however, the overall results were better this week than the past few weeks.
In the college games, it was split between the Oklahoma and Nebraska game as far as who got it right, the Auburn/Arkansas game and UCLA/Stanford game were both missed by most people.
Quite a few people also missed the Oregon/Washington St. game.
In the pros, the New Orleans/St.Louis game was missed by just about everyone, everyone missed the NY Giants/Washington game, the Minnesota/Tampa Bay game was missed by quite a few people, and the Arizona/Dallas game was also missed by about half the people.
Through all that, Rob Benson is currently in the lead with only 5 games missed.
Rob also picked Pittsburgh tonight.
Still alive for the money with 6 games missed are Joe Quenet and Jeff Miller, who both picked Tennessee tonight.
There were also 3 other people who have 6 wrong, however, they all chose Pittsburgh tonight.
Therefore, if Pittsburgh wins tonight, then Rob will win outright.
If Tennessee wins tonight, then it will come down to total points.
Rob chose 38 points, Joe has 48 points and Jeff has 34 points.
Therefore Jeff will win with a Tennessee victory and 35 or fewer total points, 36 he will tie with Rob.
Rob will also win if Tennessee wins and the total points are from 37-42 and he will also tie with Joe at 43 points.
Joe will win if Tennessee wins and there is 44 or more total points scored, 43 he will split with Rob.
We raised the entry fee to $3 per entry this week and will continue that for the rest of the season unless enough people want it back down to $2.
We had 34 entries this weekend, therefore the prize money is $102 !!
There is no Thursday night game this upcoming week, therefore this coming week's picks will be due on Friday.
Following is each person who played this week with the amount of games they missed.
Andy   Rob Benson		5 Joe Quenet		6 Jeff Miller		6 Reagan Mathews	6 Tom Chapman		6 Daniel Jenkins		6 Rick Broussard		7 Dave Ryan		7 Jaime Gualy		7 Larry Campbell		7 Cory Willis		7 Gautam Gupta		7 Michele Wilks		8 Bryce Schneider	8 Andy Pace		8 Pat Hanse		8 Russell Ballato		8 Kayne Coulter		8 Steve Pan		8 Carter Ellis		8 Valerie Ramsower	9 Robert Vargas		9 Diana Allen		9 Todd DeCook		9 Thomas Lowell		9 Ryan Williams		10 Clayton Vernon		10 Larry Jester		10 Joe Brewer		10 Mike Roan		11 Smith Day		12 Rudy Acevedo		12 Ashish Mahajan		13 Joe Step		15

979,"Welcome to Enron Center South.
As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here.
We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks.
Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.
NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.
Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.
Turret Users An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".
Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.
While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.
The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.
Here's how:  Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.
The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.
To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:   Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	 Weather Channel	12401	801	 CNN Headlines News	12402	802	 CNN Financial News	12403	803	 CNBC	12404	804	 MSNBC	12405	805	 Bloomberg	12406	806	 Financial News Network	12407	807	 CNN	12408	808	 Fox Sports	12409	809	 ESPN1	12410	810	   Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.
We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.
Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested.
We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.
Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging.
The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.
Updates will be provided as they become available.
Keeping an Open forum We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

986,"We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.
To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST).
It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.
Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:  Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week  Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:  Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems  Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products.
Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation.
Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties.
Credit limits, etc.
will be tested during the simulation.
Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.
Next steps   Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles.
You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.
Summary  This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business.
We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

992,"Thursday December 20 5:39 AM ET  Bids Open for Enron Trading Unit By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer  HOUSTON (AP) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge has set in motion the bidding process for embattled Enron Corp.'s once-dominant trading operation, which some Wall Streets insiders say could fetch up to $1 billion.
Enron said at a hearing Wednesday before Judge Arthur Gonzalez in New York that it would allow parties to bid for all or part of the wholesale trading unit.
Enron lawyer Martin J. Bienenstock said none of the 14 potential bidders to come forward so far have expressed interest in bidding for Enron's book of contracts, which Enron values at $5 billion to $7 billion.
Bids are due Jan. 7; an auction will be held Jan. 10.
Bienenstock said bidders are wary of the potential liabilities in the contracts and that the short time frame does not allow for a full review of the books.
The company, however, wants to complete the auction as soon as possible to avoid losing traders to other financial companies.
In Enron's home base of Houston Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that a state court should decide whether Enron must give rival Dynegy Inc. a key natural gas pipeline.
Dynegy claims Enron signed away its right to Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline, a prized 16,500-mile system running between Texas and the Midwest, in exchange for $1.5 billion invested in Enron before a proposed merger of the two competitors collapsed in late November.
Enron claims its smaller rival illegally terminated the $8.4 billion deal and therefore has no right to the pipeline.
Enron and had argued that Dynegy's claim should be part of Enron's massive bankruptcy case filed in federal court in New York.
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon ruled that Dynegy's suit should be heard in state court because the company's claim was not a core element of the bankruptcy.
Harmon noted that Dynegy could have sued Enron if the former energy giant didn't seek Chapter 11 protection.
``It's what we predicted,'' said David Burns, a lawyer representing Dynegy in the lawsuit.
``If we don't have Northern Natural Gas turned over to us promptly, we will ask the court to provide an accelerated trial date on this.''
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined comment on the decision.
Dynegy sued Enron in Texas state court in Houston the day after Enron filed one of the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcies in U.S. history Dec. 2 and sued Dynegy for $10 billion for breach of contract in New York.
Dynegy and other creditors also have asked that the bankruptcy case be moved to Houston, where Enron, Dynegy and many of Enron's 800 or so creditors are based.
Gonzalez will consider those requests Jan. 7.
Also Wednesday, nearly 40 of some 4,500 Enron employees laid off after the company filed for bankruptcy gathered outside Enron headquarters here to discuss the company's severance policy and sign a complaint to Enron on the lack of information.
Some carried signs that displayed the word ``Moron'' under Enron's logo and said ``What were they thinking?''
Others wore T-shirts that said ``The Execs Who Stole Christmas.''
Gonzalez on Dec. 4 $1.5 billion in short-term financing to keep the company afloat and fund $4,500 severance payments.
Former workers received those checks last week, but revelations that nearly 600 employees deemed critical to Enron's survival received more than $100 million in retention payments upset those entitled to more money under Enron's severance policy, they said.
The company's severance policy says eligible workers are entitled to a week's pay for each full or partial year of employment and another week's pay for each $10,000 they earned in salary, up to a maximum of 26 weeks.
``We would like the company to honor its commitment,'' said Pete Chase, 31, who worked for Enron Energy Services for 18 months.
Denne said the company cannot approve any severance payments above $4,500 for each employee without Gonzalez' approval.
Employees can file claims with the judge for more severance pay.
Instructions on how to do so are available on Enron's Web site (www.enron.com).
``The next step for Enron is for its creditors to assess its financial condition and assets,'' Denne said.
``Every employee is absolutely free to file a claim.''
Enron, formerly No.
7 on the Fortune 500 with stock trading near $90 a year ago, plummeted into bankruptcy after revelations of hidden debt and overstated earnings in October siphoned investor confidence and prompted traders to flee from what was once the world's largest buyer and seller of natural gas.
Dynegy abandoned a plan to buy Enron for $8.4 billion when it continued to reveal serious financial problems and Enron's credit was downgraded to junk.
Dynegy shares rose $3.08 to close at $23.98 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Enron shares were down 6 cents to 44 cents, also on the NYSE.

Prior to the  departures of Shari, Lynda, et al, there was a move afoot to create an annex  of weather definitions which could be incorporated by reference into the  confirms (or added to the Schedule), either of which approaches would shorten  the confirms considerably.

1018,"The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into  discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.
The  standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that  the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement  renews, but not beyond a specified date.
Typically TW enters into these  discount letters for a term of one month.
The marketers say that they were  once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than  a 3-month term.
I see no basis for this limitation.
The term of the FTS-1  agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.
The discount is only  applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.

The  discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement  renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date.
Does this make sense?
I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an  answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.
Drew and I have  discussed this and he is on board.

1020,"September 13, 2001  Dear JEFFREY SKILLING:  We are writing to you (and the thousands of other Texas households who have chosen NewPower as their new Retail Electric Provider) to keep you informed on the latest developments in the Texas Electric Choice Pilot program.
There have been delays in implementing the Texas Electric Choice Pilot program, but none of these delays are going to ultimately prevent NewPower from using our energy expertise to deliver savings on electricity to our customers.
Nor will they prevent your local utility from providing the same reliable service.
Here is the latest information from the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT):  1.
After several delays, we are pleased to announce the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) began processing switch requests to NewPower on July 31, 2001.
2.
Unfortunately, the switch requests are being processed by ERCOT at a much slower pace than originally promised.
3.
As a result, based on past experience, NewPower has been given estimates that your actual switch date could take place anytime between now and November 2001.
NewPower must comply with the revised ERCOT timetable.
We can't supply you with electricity until ERCOT processes the switch request.
But here's what we can do:  1.
First and foremost, we want to assure you that we are committed to providing the stability and value you were promised when you signed up with NewPower for electricity supply... despite these delays.
2.
As soon as your switch request is processed by ERCOT, we'll send you a welcome letter notifying you that your service has been switched to NewPower 3.
In the meantime, we are doing everything we can to encourage ERCOT to process your switch request more quickly so that you can receive the savings you expect from NewPower as soon as possible.

However, I asked Mary to provide me a copy of the prior year calculation.
It appears that the NNG and TW Fair Value Adjustment companies were included in the calculation this year, but were excluded last year.
A ballpark estimate is that the ETS MMF factor would drop by .1% if the NNG/TW fair value companies were excluded as they were last year.
That would mean a factor of 19.0% rather than 19.1%.

1054,"USA: INTERVIEW-EnronOnline sees volume growth, CEO says.
By Gelu Sulugiuc  07/17/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online  energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a  simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp. ,  EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with  the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks  told Reuters on Tuesday.
The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready  to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursuing mergers  or aquisitions for now, according to Greg Piper.
""I would never say never, but we're not proactively looking at aquiring an  ownership position in any other exchange platform,"" Piper said.
With an average of $3.5 billion in trades every day, EnronOnline enjoys the  highest volume of all energy electronic platforms.
Most energy trading  platforms launched last year have failed to generate profits.
Its closest rival is ICE, which routinely exceeds $1 billion a day.
But while  ICE is a many-to-many exchange that matches bids and offers, on EnronOnline  one can only trade with Enron.
""It's a tool that supercharges our market-making business,"" Piper said.
Enron is the No.
1 natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States.
About 60 percent of its transactions are captured through the electronic  platform.
""As long as we show good prices to our customers, our volumes will continue  to grow,"" Piper said.
The company is looking to grow online volume in products such as metals,  steel, weather, petrochemicals and plastics.
""We're trying to remain the leader in energy and help our other markets get  more traction,"" Piper said.
""There is a huge amount of growth that we haven't  even tapped into yet.""
Piper said he is not worried about ICE's recent success.
The Atlanta-based  exchange recently took over London's International Petroleum Exchange and  plans to transfer its open-outcry business online, significantly boosting its  trade volumes.
""Maybe six to 12 months from now, the story might be a lot different,"" Piper  said.
""But right now, there is room for the both of us.""
He added that Enron traders do not shy away from trading on ICE.
Many of the  energy giants that founded ICE and provide most of its liquidity are also  Enron's biggest clients.
""Enron will seek out a good deal on ICE when there is one,"" Piper said.
INNOVATION KEY TO SUCCESS  Recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the United States,  Enron is constantly evaluating its position in the market and thinking of  ways to become more successful.
""The right thing to do in November 1999 was to launch EnronOnline,"" Piper  said.
""But we look at it every day and if it made sense to do something  different, you can bet that Enron would do it and we wouldn't be emotional  about it.""
One of the company's advantages is the fact that its software is a flexible  application that allows EnronOnline to easily go in an out of different  markets and regions.
It constantly adds new products to its trading arsenal.
But Piper said that EnronOnline has no plans to turn itself in a many-to-many  exchange.
""We want to focus in providing our markets to others,"" he said.
""In the near  term, we're not changing that.""
The company is considering licensing the application itself, but would not  elaborate on who wants it and how much Enron would ask for it.
EnronOnline has been so successful that even its competitors take their hats  off.
""I've been hearing for two years now that a one-to-many exchange wouldn't  work, but Enron just keeps proving people wrong,"" said Frank Getman, chief  executive of online energy exchange HoustonStreet.
""If you're willing to make tight two-way markets and be the best price in the  market, then people will continue to use your site.""
Enron's stock rose 41 cents to $49.53 a share on Tuesday in trading on the  New York Stock Exchange.

1070,"Dear NewCo employees: =20 I wanted to send a note giving you my views on the NewCo opportunity and ne= xt steps.=20 =20 What are those opportunities?
In short, to date no competitor has taken En= ron's dominant market position.
In most cases, competitiors are retrenchin= g from an aggressive expansion of their deregulated business in order to pr= otect their key regulated franchises or balance sheets.
Market liquidity an= d activity is extremely fractured and highly diminished from 2000 levels.
= This will create opportunities as bid/offers expand and customers have less=  choices to manage key long-term risks.
This lack of transparancy and liqui= dity will also provide numerous opportunities, in the commodity, asset and = capital markets, to take advantage of key arbitrages across the North Ameri= can grid.
We are faced with an energy asset overhang, in the short run, w= hich is unprecedented since the early nineties.
This coupled with market p= articipants selling assets to protect balance sheets will provide many oppo= rtunities to acquire attractive energy assets at good value.
However, in th= e long-run, as we emerge from the recession and as highly energy intensive = technology investment resumes, increasing asset values, demand for energy a= nd energy price volatility are highly likely.
On the services side, there a= re numerous un-met needs in the market place at this point including demand=  side management, distributed generation amongst others that only Enron peo= ple have the complete value chain understanding to make feasible.
I also be= lieve that innovation in the energy capital markets can provide value to Ne= wCo and our customers given the blight of liquidity in capital markets.
In = short, we are at the eve of an opportunity in the energy markets which has = not been seen since the early nineties.
=20 What is NewCo?
NewCo will be a private company that will focus on the ener= gy merchant business in North America which will capitalize on the opportun= ities detailed above.
These businesses will stretch from production to mar= ket, wholesale through retail primarily in natural gas and electricity in t= he United States and Canada.
It will be a portfolio of several key business= es, services and assets supported by a common infrastructure.
It will be m= ajority owned by Enron but will have significant outside investment to ensu= re liquidity and legitimacy.
It will be re-branded and be operating and sol= vent by mid Q2 at the latest.
It will be seeded with a number of Enron ass= ets and contracts that we think add value to our business or provide key cr= edit support.
Those assets are conservatively valued at approximately $500 = million to one billion.
With asset and new cash investment, NewCo should be=  at least a billion dollar company.
It will emerge as a non-debtor company = and should be an investment grade rated company.
NewCo will employ approxim= ately 100 to 200 people depending on the mix of businesses and assets under=  control.
These people will be sourced from the existing pool of talent in=  Enron and ex-employees.
NewCo will have access to all Enron's existing sys= tems and infrastructure.
It will be in the market of buying and selling ene= rgy albeit not market making which will be restricted under the non-compete=  with Netco.I would expect that we would have a strong business and transac= tional relationship with Netco.
=20 What will be NewCo's culture?
It will have the benefits of being a small pr= ivate company which will measure success by cashflow generation.
It will b= e a small company atmosphere where everyone knows each other.
It will be a=  group that celebrates success together and works hard towards shared objec= tives.
It will have an attractive employee compensation plan particularily=  for long term value creation.
We will build an organization of integrity = of which people can be proud.
It will center its objectives around our cust= omers and the satisfying un-met needs in the market.
NewCo will value cust= omer relationships.
It will be a partnership and employ an atmosphere of o= pen communication.
NewCo will be innovative, agile and nimble.
=20 What is next?
There will be a meeting in 30C2 at 4:00 PM on Monday to discu= ss issues, questions and comments.
There will also be a dinner set up for = 6:30PM on Tuesday at the Capital Grille to provide us an opportunity to spe= nd additional social time to discuss NewCo.
NewCo will be located on the 30= th floor.
The immediate tasks in hand can be broken into the following: a)=  opportunity and business definiton including fully vetted business plans f= or opportunities identified around specific assets or independent of these = assets; b) setting up infrastructure necessary to cure defaults and start p= erforming to key operating assets including managing out of the bankruptcy;=  c) modelling cashflows, operating costs, capital requirements and proforma= 's for NewCo; d) working through the NewCo structure and path through bankr= uptcy to solvency, rating and operation; e) scouring Enron for other valuab= le assets not yet identified for NewCo; f) detailed market research;  g) as= set acquisition target definition; h) financing and capitalization plan inc= luding raising external investment and i) additional hiring and recruitment= .

1098,"CPUC Delays QF Payment Vote  Sources believe that the delay in the PUC vote on paying the QFs 15% of  their undercollected debt is likely a result from both a concern about bankruptcy issues raised by issuing what could be seen as a ""preference payment"" to the QFs (the PUC does follow these issues out of necessity, given the current environment) and a lack of clarity regarding how to implement the 15% payment.
The delay was unsurprising and characteristic of how the PUC operates.
It is also noted that there are many claims on SoCal's and PG&E's cash flows currently.
Additionally, agreeing to pay 15% of debts to the QFs raises legal issues, in that the utilities would be paying debts to some creditors, but not others.
This could increase the likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against SoCal by the non-QF creditors.

1099,"Two items of note with regard to NYISO:  - 	On November 5, 2001, PSEG Energy Resources & Trade filed a complaint against the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO), requesting that the Commission restore the original market clearing prices for energy for May 9, 2000.
PSEG claims that NYISO violated its tariff and Commission orders approving Temporary Extraordinary Procedure (TEP) authority by 1) identifying a purported market flaw associated with bids submitted by an Energy Limited Resource and 2) remedying the market flaw by re-pricing certain hourly clearing prices in a manner inconsistent with its tariff on May 8 & 9, 2000.
PSEG was a seller in the real time market on May 9, 2000 and lost revenues as a result of NYISO's Extraordinary Corrective Action.
Interventions and protests are due by November 26, 2001.
(EL02-16-000)  -	On November 16, 2001, NYISO filed a request for a stay of the Commission's decision to require the NYISO to re-bill for operating reserves for March 2000, pending the NYISO's appeal of that decision.
In March 2000, NYISO made an ""exigent circumstances"" filing seeking the imposition of various bidding restrictions to prevent alleged market power abuses.
The Commission's order only partially granted NYISO's request, and did not allow NYISO to re-calculate March 2000 operating reserves prices.
The Commission has not yet issued any notice of the filing.

1102,"All, 	I attended the Market Issues Forum at the California ISO yesterday and wanted to inform you of an important upcoming change in Grid Management (GMC) rates.
Starting January 1st, 2002, the CAISO anticipates raising GMC charges significantly.
They cited the following reasons for this:  1.
An under collection of GMC for year 2001, this must be past on to the following year according to the tariff.
2.
The lack of credit for the CAISO, increasing interest charges, as well as creating an inability to issue bonds for capital projects.
They must raise 100% of any capital expenditures in the current fiscal year, rather then spreading out the cost over a number of years with a bond issuance.
3.
A decrease in overall market volumes.
GMC is allocated on a flat fee, per megawatt basis, so decreasing volumes results in decreasing collections.
The CAISO points out their costs will remain flat from 2001 to 2002.
They anticipate volume levels next year similar to what current volumes are, thus reducing the amount of megawatts they can effectively spread out their GMC charges over.
I have the following observations:  1.
Despite the decrease in volumes, and the decrease in overall market activity, the CAISO has no plans to reduce its current workforce of 500+ employees.
2.
When posed the question: Is CERS charged GMC for out of market energy?
Their answer was circumspect at best.
3.
The CAISO currently does not assess GMC charges to ancillary service volumes, they indicated however that they are strongly considering changing this policy to increase the denominator that they can spread out GMC.
The CAISO would also like to point out that these increases are worse case scenarios, and may not be this high.
But as we are all aware, in the California energy market, the worst-case scenario ends up looking optimistic in comparison to what actually ends up happening.
Below is a detailing of the changes.

1105,"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.
Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.
We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.
While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.
The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.
It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.
We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.
Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.
Ken    Dear ETS Colleague:  On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.
The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.
In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.
Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.
The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.
For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.
Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.
Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.
Keep up the good work!

1107,"Parties represented at an informal meeting after the February 7, 2000  prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the CAC  settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement  conferences.
Transwestern Pipeline Company submits the following comments in  lieu of a redlined document.
Transwestern fully supports the CAC's proposal of a path-defined receipt  point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt  points on the SoCalGas system.
Not only does the proposal satisfy the  Commission's requirement that Hector Road be established as a formal receipt  point, it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use  of the SoCalGas system, and will help provide a reasonable degree of  certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas  transportation.
CAC's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no  upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to SoCal's  system.
Transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain  details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not  been fully described in the CAC document.
To this end, Transwestern proposes  that implementation of the receipt point proposal be included on the agenda  for the upcoming all-party settlement discussions.
Transwestern looks  forward to a constructive discussion of the proposal and is confident that  the parties will be able to agree on a plan for implementation.

1133,"This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at  downstream points.
Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to  tender fuel to us at their receipt points.
With rare exceptions, those  receipt points are not at the Cal.
border.
Order 636 mandates that pipelines  unbundle transportation from storage.
It also requires that pipelines that  make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.
That  latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point ""x"", it should  resell the gas at point ""x"" and not haul the gas to point ""y"" and then sell  it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.
My concern this morning was  that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that  gas to the Cal.
border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement  (because the Cal.
border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the  transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the ""furthest  upstream point"" requirement or both.
Susan and my recollection was that when  ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than  Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where  they wanted it.
I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling  that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around  whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.
To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.
Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.
Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.
After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.
Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.
I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.
We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

1172,"UtiliCorp to Re-Acquire and Then Become Aquila  UtiliCorp United announced plans to buy back the 20% of its trading and risk management arm, Aquila Inc., that it sold to the public earlier this year and adopt Aquila as its corporate name.
The move is a strategic reversal apparently prompted by the weakening economy and industry changes.
Executives dodged questions as to whether the move was spurred by the financial troubles at the energy industry's largest trading house, Enron Corp.  On this busy Wednesday, UtiliCorp also released its earnings, and reported that it has entered into an acquisition agreement with a FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary.
UtiliCorp said its board of directors voted to make an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common shares of its 80%-owned Aquila Inc. subsidiary due to the ""recent significant changes in the merchant energy sector, the general economy and the impact of these changes on the capital markets.""
""The most significant influence, however, was the realization that greater shareholder value could be obtained by recombining the financial strength of UtiliCorp with the growth opportunities that lie ahead for Aquila,"" said Richard C. Green, Jr., chairman and CEO of UtiliCorp.
""With its larger asset base, earnings potential and cash flow, the combined company will have more efficient access to capital to execute its ambitious plans.
Industry-watchers questioned whether some of the spark for the recombining of the trading operation with the hard-asset backed parent, could have been prompted by Enron's current debacle.
When asked during the conference call if the Enron situation factored in the decision to combine UtiliCorp and Aquila, Robert Green said, ""The decision evolved over the recent few weeks as we evaluated the opportunities in front of Aquila, and the current conditions in the capital market.
[We] effectively came to the conclusion that if we are going to put Aquila in a position to execute on these opportunities, it is essential that we recombine the businesses and the balance sheets to execute on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace that are precipitated by the decline in the capital markets, and the fact that the equity markets are shutdown.""
""The merchant strategy behind Aquila's rapid growth has been a key driver behind UtiliCorp's achievement of aggressive earnings targets,"" Richard Green said.
""We decided that UtiliCorp shareholders would be better served by embracing the Aquila energy merchant strategy as the company's core strategy, rather than spinning the business off as a separate entity.
To symbolize that change in thinking, we intend to adopt 'Aquila' as our corporate name after our exchange offer is completed.""
The company said in its conference call that it expects to complete the reacquisition of Aquila by ""early January.""
Richard Green also said he will take on a new role, effective Jan. 1, 2002, initially as chairman of UtiliCorp and later of the new company that will be formed from UtiliCorp United and Aquila, Inc. Robert K. Green, president and COO of UtiliCorp, will be elevated to president and CEO of the new Aquila.
UtiliCorp said all public Aquila shareholders will be offered 0.6896 shares of UtiliCorp common stock in a tax-free exchange for each outstanding share of Aquila Class A common stock.
Based on yesterday's closing price of $17.99 per share for Aquila Class A common stock and $30 per share for UtiliCorp common stock, the offer represents a value of $20.69 per Class A share of Aquila and a 15% premium to yesterday's closing price of those shares.
""Aquila shareholders will have the opportunity to continue to participate in Aquila's growth through their ongoing ownership of UtiliCorp shares, and to receive cash dividends as UtiliCorp shareholders,"" Richard Green said.
The offer requires that at least a majority of Aquila's publicly held Class A shares are tendered.
After successful completion of the exchange offer, UtiliCorp has committed to complete a 'short-form' merger of Aquila with a UtiliCorp subsidiary.
In the merger, each remaining Aquila Class A share will be converted (subject to the exercise of appraisal rights) into the same number of shares of UtiliCorp common stock as are paid in the exchange offer.
UtiliCorp plans to file its offering materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission and commence the exchange offer as soon as possible.
""Over the past year, I have devoted an increasing amount of time and energy to raising other chief executives' awareness of Aquila's broad capabilities,"" Richard Green said.
""We have a unique position in the emerging market that is being created by the convergence of the insurance, capital and energy businesses, combining our expertise in risk management, wholesale energy, structured financing, generation assets and other related activities.
We can help clients in countless industries in ways they've never thought of, and that opportunity is largely driving this change in executive roles.""
The company also reported Wednesday that it expects to enter into an acquisition agreement with FirstEnergy Corp. under which UtiliCorp and a financial partner will purchase FirstEnergy's wholly owned Avon Energy Partners Holdings subsidiary, the holding company for Midlands Electricity plc.
Midlands Electricity is the fourth-largest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom and serves 2.3 million network customers.
UtiliCorp said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2002 after receipt of regulatory approvals.
In the company's conference call, Robert Green said the acquisition would likely be ""strongly accretive"" in 2002.
In releasing its earnings, UtiliCorp followed the strong third quarter results from its Aquila subsidiary and reported earnings per share for the third quarter 2001 were $0.58, up 16% from last year's third quarter after adjusting for the $0.30 gain from the 2000 initial public offering of Uecomm, Ltd. in Australia.
The company posted earnings for the quarter of $68.9 million, a decrease from the $74.9 million mark for the same quarter of 2000.
UtiliCorp said energy sales for the quarter were $9.3 billion, up 16% from $8 billion during the third quarter of 2000.
""At Aquila, we continue to see increasing client demand for our risk management solutions,"" said Robert Green.
""In addition, our recent capacity acquisitions are performing beyond our expectations.
Our network businesses continue to help fuel our core growth in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).
Combining that with the solid results from Aquila, UtiliCorp continues to be on track to deliver at least 15% earnings growth this year.""
UtiliCorp CFO Dan Streek said during the conference call that the company expects 2001 EPS to be in the area of $2.95.
The CFO added that this ""far exceeds"" the company's 15% growth target.
For 2002 guidance, Streek said the combined EPS for UtiliCorp and Aquila would be around $2.92.
Earnings before income taxes (EBIT) for the quarter UtiliCorp were led by strong contributions from Aquila as well as the international business segment.
Aquila's operations increased from $40.8 million to $44.2 million (net of minority interests of $7.4 million) in the 2001 third quarter, marking a 26% increase.
UtiliCorp attributed some of Aquila's growth to the fact that gas and power commodity markets are slowing down, forcing Aquila's clients to focus more on risk and how they can minimize exposure.
As a result, Aquila has seen an increase in its client-focused businesses.
Additionally, Aquila's December 2000 acquisition of interests in six power plants through its purchase of GPU International have provided stronger-than-expected operating results.
The company reported that gas trading volumes in the third quarter increased 11%, from 12.1 Bcf/d during the third quarter 2000 to 13.4 Bcf/d.
Power volumes increased 98%, from 44 million MWh to 87 million MWh.
EBIT from international networks increased 57% to $48.5 million from $30.9 million in the 2000 third quarter, excluding last year's gain of $44 million or $.30 per share from the initial public offering of Uecomm, Ltd.
The company said EBIT from Canada and Australia increased, primarily due to the full quarter contribution of electric properties in Alberta, purchased on Aug. 31, 2000, and strong performance in Australia related to continued strength in the United Energy business and the addition of AlintaGas, which was purchased in October 2000.
In the United States, UtiliCorp's networks had EBIT of $47.4 million in the third quarter of 2001, compared to $45.3 million in the 2000 period.
The company said the contribution from the St. Joseph Light & Power division, acquired at the end of 2000, was partially offset by higher operating costs.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines,  personnel responsibilities and key action items.
I think this is another  good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and  assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very  smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.
You will like him and  he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a  couple of weeks.
He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse  engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.
He has  others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his  existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper  already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the  short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she  could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good  option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary  Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck  (advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick  thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early  versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the  marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.
I wanted him to make sure  that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John  Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday  afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to  add a trading perspective?
A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.

1179,"Attached for your review and comment is a first draft of the WPTF motion to intervene and protest the WestConnect filing.
The major points made in it are as follows:  ?
The Commission should convene a technical conference to deals with areas in the WestConnect filing that require further clarification, such as congestion management.
Moreover, the analysis of congestion management issues must focus on the equitable allocation of transmission rights;  ?
The Commission should require WestConnect to establish an independent board, with an accompanying stakeholder process that complies with commission precedent;  ?
All load should be required to take service under the WestConnect tariff;   ?
Interconnection issues should be deferred until completion of the Commission's generic proceeding on this topic; and  ?
Since a for-profit Transco has an inherent incentive to maximize transmission revenue, there are certain RTO functions that an entity such as WestConnect should not perform.
I am indebted to Karen Shea of Dynegy and Glenn Martin of Mirant for their very helpful assistance.
Our draft also draws upon concepts contained in the EPSA filing that Gary Ackerman provided.
The filing is due at FERC on Thursday the 15th.
I therefore need any comments from you no later than early that morning.

That filing will  be made before Dec. 1, 2000.
General:  TW has done three deals in the last week at rates in excess of TW's  maximum tariff rate.

Pursuant to that authority,  TW has filed negotiated rate tariff sheets with the FERC, which are docketed  at Docket No.

I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.
As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.
Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.
Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.
JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.
Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.
Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!
We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.
The theme for the walk this year is ""Mission: Possible"" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.
The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.
If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.

Tim's best intelligence is that a June 1 closing  date is the best they can hope for and it may be late June or later.
Also,   until the deal actually closes, there is always a small chance it could come  undone.
If we get Gallup in service May 1, we have a 1 month or greater bust  between our in service date and the date the cheap electric rate kicks in.
Has Courtney got this covered?
I suspect he's been thrashing around so much  on locking in the swap that it hasn't been on his radar screen.
I think we should formally notify ECS that we expect them to negotiate a  favorable interim power deal to cover the gap between our in service date and  the merger closing.
(the difference between the $.038 and .067 rate was  about $200,000/ month as I recall, so this is worth some real $$$)  Also, we  ought to remind Courtney that he is still obligated to find a better deal for  us if the merger goes south for some reason.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.
In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

Governor To Address State  BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN   DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.
BODY:  ??
?While Gov.
Gray Davis prepared to speak to the state Thursday night about California's energy crisis, economic forecasters predicted the power crunch would lead to higher taxes and scrapped public projects.
?
?Davis said Wednesday he hadn't written his five-minute address, but that he planned to discuss ''the progress that we've made and what we have to get through.''
?
?Among other things, he was expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases approved last week by the Public Utilities Commission for customers of the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.  and Southern California Edison Co.
He has asked California television stations to carry his remarks live.
?
?California has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power supplies blamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs.
?
?On Wednesday, the state got more bad economic news: The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast said Californians would face higher taxes and a tighter  state budget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency  power.
The blackouts and the state's scrutiny of private power suppliers also  threaten to scare away new businesses, the report said.
?
?Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy prices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a windfall-profits tax on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to  California this year.
?
?A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly.
It would tax gross receipts that ''significantly exceed'' the cost of producing power and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold  it at much higher rates.
??
''We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state.
This  profiteering must stop,'' Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said.
?
?Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selected industry would be legal.
He added that such a tax would discourage generators from building new power plants in California.
??
''The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can  to increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price.
Windfall-profits taxes do neither of these,'' Williams said.
?
?Davis said he generally opposes treating profitable companies in that  manner, ''but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense.
The only things companies understand is leverage.''
?
?For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their power from generators instead of going through the utilities.
?
?The Utility Reform Network and the head of the PUC oppose the idea.
They argue residential customers and small businesses unable to contract with generators would get stuck with the bill for the billions of dollars the state has and will spend buying electricity for the customers of the cash-strapped utilities.
HEADLINE: 'Chaos' in state electricity planning  BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens  BODY:  ?
?LOS ANGELES _ Two hundred of the finest economic minds in California  gathered Wednesday at UCLA's Anderson School of Management to discuss the state's  energy crisis but, as state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch  spoke, the power to her microphone cut out intermittently and unexpectedly.
??
""I don't have any control over this,"" the beleaguered technician operating the sound system called out after repeated outages.
??
""I feel your pain,"" Lynch replied with a smile.
?
?No one in the audience doubted that.
After two rounds of rolling blackouts that state officials were powerless to prevent, Lynch last week led the commission to hike retail power rates 42 percent, sparking protests from consumer groups.
?
?But at UCLA Lynch had power and natural gas producers in her sights.
She promised to lead ""a war against the sellers who are taking so much value out  of the California economy and not adding a whit of value.""
?
?Lynch said she favored reinstatement of wholesale price caps that were ended by the Federal Energy Rate Commission in December but wasn't counting on that.
?
?Even without those caps, she said she was optimistic that the state had enough tools to restrain price hikes by wholesalers and avoid another rate  hike.
?
?Those tools include conservation, purchases of long-term power contracts by the Department of Water Resources, utility cost cutting and making sure the small power producers known as qualifying facilities are online, she said.
?
?Lynch dismissed the state's 1996 deregulation plan as a ""failed experiment"" and said she did not accept a questioner's premise that ""true deregulation is our goal.""
The problem was that ""the state stepped back too much"" from management of the power system and that there had been ""too much ideology and theory and not enough practical solutions,"" she added.
?
?A panel of experts offered some grim predictions.
""We are expecting severe difficulties for this summer and next summer,"" said Barry Sedlik, a Southern California Edison manager.
?
?Mark Bernstein, an analyst with the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, said the electricity problems are spreading.
""This may go on for a while and it's not just California,"" he said.
""In the near term we've got chaos,"" he added.
?
?But he offered one macabre ray of hope.
He said that federal policymakers  may feel more urgency to step in if, as now appears possible, rolling  blackouts occur in 2002 in Florida where, he didn't need to add, President  Bush's brother is governor.
?
?Problems with the transmission system there, as well as generation shortage, could hurt Florida but the state has enough time to avoid a crisis, he said in an interview.

Securing transmission will be challenging due to the fact that BEB has the most onerous grid access terms in Germany.
However, the gas team is hopeful these transactions will bring about a turning point in gaining access to customers within BEB's territory, which until Enron closed on these deals was considered to be the ""heart land"" of Germany.
Enron Names New UK Coal-Hauling Freight Locomotive On Saturday, 1st September, a ten-strong delegation from Enron's coal team traveled up to British Energy's Eggborough coal-fired power station to take part in the naming ceremony for a newly-acquired Class 66 freight locomotive, recently put into service by Enron business partner and rail freight specialist, Freightliner Heavy Haul.
Enron and Freightliner Heavy Haul signed a contract for UK coal transport in June 2000, effectively breaking the local monopoly in the rail transport of coal held by an incumbent rail freight company.
True to form, the introduction of competition has reduced rates and dramatically improved service levels.
Stuart Staley, Enron's international coal group vice-president, praised the dedication of the Freightliner train drivers and staff who have contributed to the success of the service for Enron.
While Eddie Fitzsimons, managing director of Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd noted:  'We only started running coal trains in December 2000 and we have now run more than 17,000 individual wagon journeys containing more than one million tonnes of coal, almost all of that for Enron.'
The coal team selected the name Don Raider from numerous entries received from an earlier Globalflash competition:  ""The new locomotive was named Don Raider, after the river Don, a major river in South Yorkshire where a number of our customers are located,"" explains Tom Kearney, a director in Enron's international coal group who executed the original deal with Freightliner.
""Other ""Raider Class"" Freightliner Heavy Haul locomotives will be named at a later date, each bearing the name of a river which flows near to coal-fired power stations and major coal-importing ports.""
While mischievous Enron employees may think the name sounds suspiciously like a covert activity carried out by the new market entrants, we can assure you that would simply be speculation!
Congratulations again to the Coal team on securing this landmark deal.

1255,"Dear Ken,  I wrote you some time back about the campaign to raise ca.
$4 million to replace the American Heart Association's Houston regional headquarters building which burned this past April.
You were so kind in putting us in touch with Cindy Olson and Misha Siegel to discuss Enron's corporate position and the potential for assistance from the Ken and Linda Lay Foundation.
We deeply appreciated our meeting with Cindy and Misha.
Things have been progressing I'm pleased to say.
AHA has concluded a deal to sell the restored old building for approximately $1.15 million, and we have received substantial commitments from a very few individuals and Houston area foundations totaling approximately $600,000.
Therefore, our remaining challenge is to raise around $2-$2.25 million to complete the funding of a new building that will meet the needs of AHA in the years to come.
We have not yet been able to identify a very visible corporate or professional lead for the effort.
We will be discussing this possibility with Ernie Cockrell on November 6th.
As part of that conversation we would like to indicate notable leaders in Houston who would be willing to have their names affiliated with the capital campaign, perhaps as an Executive Committee or Advisory Committee.
The question to you is:  Would you approve the use of your name in your capacity at Enron and/or the name of the Ken and Linda Lay Foundation in this way?
Again, the AHA and I have been so deeply appreciative of your willingness to support the American Heart Association for so many years.
I hope we can call on you for this additional assistance at a time of need.
Thanks, Ken, for your consideration.

In this scenario, there are 4 marketing employees which would come to Enron as a part of the deal.
A few things:  In this case, I'm assuming these employees would resign from Vulcan and Enron would extend the appropriate offer.
Secondly, Enron's purchase of the marketing rights will be for an 18mo to 3 year trial period.
At the end of the trial period, if Enron returns the marketing rights to Vulcan (or current owner), they want the right to re-call these employees.

I've been battling with this thing all day and it's gotten me nowhere.
The version of  EOL Deal Report I've been using for the past month, and which  Carla used for several months prior to that, has come down with the winter  blues and will no longer produce anything.
Here is the error message it gives  me:  Cannot create file c:\eolJF.txt.
It responds this way no matter what combination of requests I give it.
One  interesting detail is that it began doing this on 12/21, the night before I  left for vacation (thus my delay in dealing with this problem), and on that  same night I noticed that the report looked different than usual.
Actually,  it looked exactly like the stage version that Nadine and I worked with today.
It had the new section at the bottom titled ""Uncheck 'Desk Summary Only' to  enable""; whereas the version I had been using did not.
Our IT guys deferred to you on this subject, so I'm still at a loss as to how  to test the new stage version of the EOL report, as I have nothing to test it  against.
My feeling is that, even though the new version has a few quirks, it  would be better than nothing and so should be put into production - because  in the meantime I'm going to have to use it anyway - it's all I have now!

1282,"Thanks for your note - hope you have time for a little fun while you're in SF  - or at least some good food.
The Moorings said they should be able to put your part on the credit card if  you want.
Their number is 800-535-7289; our contract number is 507645 and  it's under my name.
The guy I talked to said he'll have to call during  regular business hours when the bookkeeping department is open.
Each  person's share is currently $905.33.
That includes one night in the Moorings  hotel so will go down by 55.50 or so if you decide not to stay there at all.
Beverages are covered by a separate payment.
I'll be glad to fax the invoice  when you get a number for me.
If you want to send me your check, that's  fine, or Bruce can do it - makes no difference to me.
Regarding ""connectedness,""  there were no internet cafes the last time I was  there.
While that may have changed, there won't be more than one or two in  the entire place, I'm sure.
Were you planning on bringing your laptop?
If  so, it would make sense to find a 12 volt charger cable that will plug into a  lighter socket or bring extra batteries - we won't have 110 volt current on  the boat except the first - and maybe one other - night.
It will be easy to  check voice mails since we will have a cell phone on board.
But it's not  cheap (as I remember it it was $1/min.
to receive a call from the States and  $2/min.
to place one) and I'm reasonably comfortable that you won't be able  to plug into it.
I'm not sure if your US cell phone will work there or not.
We can find out from the Moorings.
I have an international cell phone I'm  bringing along that also has infrared capability.
Does your laptop have one  of those ir receivers?
If so, I can bring along the software you need to  work it with this phone.
Not to be defeatist and I'm sure the times have  changed but I remember one trip 7 or 8 years ago where a friend needed to  receive & send some faxes so we stopped at a little island hotel and asked if  we could use their fax machine - they said yes but had never seen anyone send  or receive more than a 2 or 3 page fax before and our 50 and 60 pagers soon  ran the machine out of paper.
When we asked for more paper it turns out we  had used the last piece on the island - they were not amused.
Ted asked me to remind you to be thinking about music.
Let me just add in  the spirit of self-preservation that it's a good idea.
It's not safe to  ignore this issue since if we leave him to his own devices we may not hear  much other than Van Halen and Iron Maiden.
Obviously feel free to bring as  many of your own cd's as you want & if you let us know what types of tunes  you like we'll try and bring ours (if any) that match.
Don't worry too much  about Ted's taste - I always insist that he bring along a Walkman &  headphones!
Glad to hear the company is doing well, but just in case you need some ideas  with some of your projects, I got this from a friend this morning:  The tribal wisdom of the Dakota Indians, passed on from one generation to the next, says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy is to dismount.
However, in modern business, because of the heavy investment factors to be taken into consideration, often other strategies have to be tried with dead horses, including the following:       1.
Buying a stronger whip.
2.
Changing riders.
3.
Threatening the horse with termination.
4.
Appointing a committee to study the horse.
5.
Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.
6.
Lowering the standards so that dead horses can be included.
7.
Appointing an intervention team to reanimate the dead horse.
8.
Creating a training session to increase the riders load share.
9.
Reclassifying the dead horse as living-impaired.
10.
Change the form so that it reads: ""This horse is not dead.""
11.
Hire outside contractors to ride the dead horse.
12.
Harness several dead horses together for increased speed.
13.
Donate the dead horse to a recognized charity, thereby deducting           its full original cost.
14.
Providing additional funding to increase the horse's performance.
15.
Do a time management study to see if the lighter riders would           improve productivity.
16.
Purchase an after-market product to make dead horses run faster.
17.
Declare that a dead horse has lower overhead and therefore performs           better.
18.
Form a quality focus group to find profitable uses for dead horses.
19.
Rewrite the expected performance requirements for horses.
20.
Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.

1283,"Brothers,     My youngest son Joe, a Beta pledge at Auburn, called me last night to inform me their chapter's charter has been revoked, effectively ending 34 years of Beta's at Auburn.
At a recent costume party, several pledges (Joe NOT being one of them) decided it would be funny to mock the all black fraternity on campus by painting their faces black and wearing that frat's letters.
As unbelivable as it seems, that one act set off a chain reaction in Oxford and the General Secy flew down and, in a two sentence statement, ended life for the Betas as they once knew it.
The incident coincided with the Delta Sig chapter doing something even more stupid at a separate party on a separate day where pictures showed up on the internet by their party photographer of three D Sigs dressed as a black, a KKK clansman and a Confederate soldier, all looking as if they were trying to hang or shoot the black.
Brilliant huh???
That incident really got the student body in an uproar and then the Beta deal came to light about the same time and bam, goodbye Betas.
I only tell the story here because there have been many news coverages of both events across the country, making the Betas look like they were way out of line when, in fact, it was pretty harmless and the black fraternity really was only tremendously upset with the D Sigs.
Joe, his pledge brothers, and the actives are in shock at the severity of the decision by Oxford and I must admit, so am I.
If any of you out there have any ideas on what to do about it, I certainly would welcome them.
Joe was really falling in love with that chapter and it had a ton of campus leaders in it, much like Gamma Omega did once upon a time.
My feeling is that the chapter deserved some serious and accountable disciplinary punishments and the chapter agreed what they did was stupid and in horrible taste, but to abolish a 34 year old, 120 man chapter for the actions of a few?????
I'm really pissed.

1284,"Debbie and Tanya: I thought it might be helpful to summarize how certain of the collateral provisions in our trading agreements are impacted by the filing of bankruptcy:  1.
ISDA Credit Support Annex - Paragraph 4 provides that our counterparties do not have to post or release collateral to us if either an Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Specified Condition has occurred or if an Early Termination Date has been designated for which an unsatisfied payment obligation exists.
In addition, as you are aware, we can no longer hold cash or LC's, and as we discussed, since this language technically applies to LC's as well, it might be worth it to appoint a QI to hold our LC's for us.
2.
Industrial Master - same as above except that the limitation on holding collateral only applies to cash.
3.
Annex B - the Event of Default/Early Termination Date conditions only apply to requests to reduce collateral, not to a demand to post collateral.
There is no QI requirement for holding collateral.
4.
EEI Master (without new collateral annex attached)- no conditions precedent in the EEI to posting or releasing collateral.
There is no QI requirement for holding collateral.
The new collateral annex works like the ISDA Credit Support Annex except  that the limitation on holding collateral only applies to cash   5.
Enfolio Master Purchase and Sale Agreement -  no conditions precedent in the Enfolio to posting or releasing collateral.
There is no QI requirement for holding collateral.

1286,"Dear Ken:  I am very sad to see what has happened to such a big icon in Houston.
I am very sorry to see you struggle through this and try to remain at a high level.
I am very pleased to see you chose to stay with the company and work at what I hope is its new birth and positive rise in society and business community.
I had a chance to meet with you a little over a year ago at a charity function.
While I am no expert in the energy business and I'm but a college student at the present time, I would like to share a view from the other side of the inner loop your used to.
Before I met you everyone I spoke with had nothing but wonderful things to say about you and what a genious you are.
After the news came out about the misfortune of Enron, some of those same people started bad mouthing some of the same people they praised.
It made me sick and made me think very little of those individuals.
I was concerned because I could not believe that you would intentionally and knowingly do something that would jeopardize the very company you helped build.
The day I saw you make the decision to not leave or step down as CEO I knew then that you must not have been directly involved in the coverup done by your previous COO and a couple of other top executives you had entrusted.
Those few people,!
one of which you had recently hired, all quit just before the news came out about Enron bookkeeping.
I feel safe in saying you must have been misadvised by those few people or you did not know what they were doing behind your back.
It is obvious they were not working for Enron like you, but rather ""at"" Enron to try to steal as much money and benefites they could and then head for the hills, which is what they did.
The mere act of having several top executives quit working at Enron after a short stay at the company and then cashing out on their holdings tells me it was intentional and I consider them thieves.
It would be a different story had they stayed like you and really cared about the company and what it represents and does for society as a whole.
I feel very sorry for those investors and employees who have been devestated by what has happened.
BUT, it makes me very angry to hear people and writers casting stones on you and a company that has done so much over the past several years for so many.
Enron has funded more charity events and backed more functions and elections than most.
Now when the tide has turned and (due to a few greedy top executive decisions) Enron is in the position of needing help, everyone is out for blood and looking to end a company that still represent the same work it did before, but whose value has decreased because of word of mouth and the stupid greed of your previous employees.
Some people I have talked with say Enron is finished and is only a matter of time before it is gone.
That makes me angry too.
From what I see you have not given up on the company nor have you abandoned ship.
That tells me you may be trying to rebuild the company and its reputation.
That would be the greatest thing to do and show those who are out for Enrons demise (and who can do nothing but bad mouth) just what your really made of and put them in their place.
I have been reading nothing but negative articles about the company.
I feel like it is not the company, because that would mean every single employee would be to blame.
Rather the writers should focus on the few individuals who cashed out and split.
I would hope you could remember back 4 or 5 years ago when the company was really thriving and doing well.
I hope you can remember the good things about the company and the fact that it can still (and does) make money from its businesses.
It can turn around if you want it to.
I would hope you can make the trading business and other companies held by Enron what it once was without having to sell off too many of the future profitable ones and make use of the two beutiful buildings now towering over Houston's skyline.
I call those Houston's twin towers.
Other large companies in the past have turned around after similar set backs as horrible as this with Enron.
Your turn around would be record setting.
I heard about others (like the teachers retirement fund) making noise about wanting to take Enron to court because they invested millions.
That is stupid because it is their choice to invest and their risk to take, especially making it after the news broke about the company.
Sure they trusted that Dynegy would merge, so perhaps their frustration should be aimed at Dynegy or perhaps use their collective educated minds together to help find a way to turn Enron around and make their investment purposful rather than throwing stones.
I think Dynegy is a wonderful company as well, but it ""was mean"" for them to come out and say ""yes they would merge"" and then not.
I realize it's all business and people like to make money, but it's another thing to flat steal and lie (like your executives you trusted did) rather than profit from hard work and honesty.
I personally know of many large corporations and politicians who have things to hide that would cause problems like yours.
Your company is not alone, which is why I am so angry at others throwing stones at you and Enron.
This would not happen if there were'nt executives in corporate industries like the ones you entrusted your company to who try to take rather than give and earn from it.
Perhaps many should learn from Colleen Barrett, COO of Southwest Airlines.
Do you know that they are the only airlines to refuse federal aid recently and they are doing better then most airlines.
Good luck and thank you for hanging in there and making me believe there are still some good top CEO's out there.

It might be more advantageous for a variety of reasons to do a structure in which Enron mergers with the ultimate publicly traded company (whether existing Dynegy or a new holding company) with that publicly traded company being the nominal survivor.
Under Delaware, Oregon, and most other states' law, the surviving company automatically would assume all of Enron's obligations as a matter of law, and the merger agreement would so provide if this structure were used.

We obviously have a lot to talk about.
Last week we reported third quarter earnings.
We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.
Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.
I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.
As usual, I will be as candid as I can.
I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.
I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

He was inquiring as to the cost of an interconnect and approximately 2 miles of pipe for Phase 1 - 105 mmbtu, and Phase 2 - 210 mmbtu.
He said he felt confident that 10"" pipe could be used and asked if I could provide him with a ball park number on cost for Phase 1.
If I understood him correctly the location of the interconnect will be somewhere between West Texas and Roswell...
I didn't really get to much detail as I informed him that I would get in contact with someone that could provide him with the info requested.

I have checked with Cris Sherman and others in Accounting, they have determined that the ""East Desk"" does not have to accelerate the payment of its ""debt"" to John Arnold's book if we get out of the Hopewell transaction.
That being said, you were checking on the real $$$ exposure to retaining the Hopewell deal past the VNG transaction.
The way we are currently booked we are not interested in restructuring the VNG/Hopwell arrangement.
If on the other hand we see real $$$ exposure, this is the perfect time to try to combine the VNG restructuring with the Hopwell exposure.

The meeting went well and I believe we now have a lot of momentum to move forward on all fronts.
I met with Felicia Garland today to recap the meeting and want to summarize for you both:  	Broadband: Felicia met with Kim Godfrey, EBS, this morning as well and they are moving forward to get a meeting set up to get David Cox and John Echols 		in front of Bob Golden and others who make operational decisions within Pru.
RAC meeting:  Felicia and I went through the list of who Enron would bring to the table and she is going to confer with Matt Chanin regarding who Pru would bring and 		determine the best location and time for the meeting.
We expect that both of these meetings will not happen until July.
Voluntary Platform (or Working Solutions):  A meeting is scheduled for this Thursday with Pru and Jennifer Medcalf (Enron Global Strategic Sourcing), Sarah Davis 		and Cynthia Barrow (both with Enron HR).
Andy, if you feel it is appropriate, a call to Cynthia Barrow might be helpful.
New Power Company:  Felicia is very excited about including a ""portal"" for NPW in their voluntary platform and would also like to possibly extend that to their 			corporate relocation platform.
Andy, let me know the best way to proceed after you call Gene Lockhart.
Corporate Relocation:  We didn't talk much about this yesterday but Felicia is going to pursue Pru offering their services to Enron.

Regarding the Savings Plan, would I be allowed to leave the funds in  the plan, as if I had retired, or would I be required or permitted to roll  those amounts into a rollover IRA?

Hopefully we'll get back on a schedule after the first of the year.
Below is my update on a few GISB matters.
We'll go into more detail at our next meeting.
ENERGY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BOARD (EISB) The GISB Board of Directors has approved revisions to GISB's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to incorporate language necessary to transition to the new organization, which will address standards for wholesale and retail gas and electric transactions.
The new organization, which goes into effect January 1, 2002, will be named the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB).
The wholesale gas quadrant, which is now GISB, should continue with business as usual.
In January, I'll give a more detailed update on the workings of NAESB.
GISB REPRESENTATON Stan Horton's term on the GISB Board of Directors expires December 31, 2001.
Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board.
Her term expires December 31, 2003.
My term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003.
ORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING The development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete.
The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002.
This is probably a firm date.
The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed.
GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATA Two separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards.
The errors in the standards books are extensive.
The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books.
I am working to have GISB correct the standards books.
Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version.
Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books.

The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:  ?
Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.
The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.
?
After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.
As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.
?
The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.
Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.
This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.
These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.

He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.
Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.
Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets.
He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.
Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.
In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.
I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.
I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.
Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.
But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.
The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.
Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

1357,"Just in case you're checking your e-mail in between spa sessions, here's an  update:  The BPA Business Plan has not yet arrived.
Sir Speedy just arrived with copies of the EIS, which were supposed to be  finished at noon.
So I'm a little frustrated with this lack of efficiency.
I've left a message  at BPA regarding the whereabouts of our order; I've scolded Sir Speedy for  the delay; and one way or another I'll get the documents out to Terrell Gault  and Jim Fell tomorrow.
I'm sure the last thing you want to hear while you're escaping from it all is  that things aren't going according to planned back in the office; but I  thought you should know just in case you hear from either of these guys.
Nothing to worry about, though.
You can now resume your poolside position.

Because of work  commitments, Kristi is arriving at 12:30pm.
The 3 of us will get a rental  car and make our way to your place.
Are you going to be home then?
Then we  will go pick up Kristi later.
We have no plans at the moment (other than  going to the game on Saturday).
We are leaving on Sunday at an awful time,  though, 6:30am.
They didn't give me many options using reward travel.
We  are all looking forward to the trip.
See you on Thursday.

1362,"Jim / Evan -   As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.
As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.
We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.
All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.
In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.
Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.
I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

1363,"Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.
In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:  Producer/Wellhead Group  The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.
This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.
The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.
Strategic Asset  Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.
This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.
This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.
Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.
There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.
Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

I was in Phoenix last year and thought it was wonderful except for  the fact that people age faster.
I didn't go to Baton Rouge for Passover  since the seders were in the middle of the week.
But I know that my sister  ordered everything from the Second Avenue Deli in N.Y. and various other  Manhattan establishments.
My niece has been accepted at that high school in  Natchitoches for smart kids and Deb is really happy (and sad).
Jennifer is  only 15.
My nephew is tall, handsome and driving Steve crazy.
My parents  are fine and my Dad is going to have a knee-cap replacement sometime soon.
He'll be 83 in June.
I've decided on in-house training for my dogs and the  trainer thinks that CHLOE needs the most ""help"" since that sweet little  bichon may try to bite strangers (and maybe friends!)
in my home.
Otherwise,  I'm rocking along.
You know, I never called Helen but I still have her  number and I'll do it this week.
Hope all is well.

1426,"Lynn/Karen:   The November 1 termination of the reverse auction point on Northern will increase the probability of priority mismatches at Aberdeen and Welcome between our two systems.
We have already received questions asking how we will confirm these points after the 1st.
And our response has been that we would expect the restricting party to dictate who can and cannot flow at these locations.
One party that has been surprisingly quiet so far has been Mirant.
Mirant should be very interested in how we will allocate capacity at these two points on November 1, simply because their contracts have the greatest risk of not being scheduled.
They are the only firm shipper on Northern Border that have Aberdeen and Welcome as contracted path end points.
And as you know, they supplied the reverse auction point.
But from what we have heard on the street, they are not actively matching up their supply with those markets who were allocated reverse auction capacity on your system.
That is why I feel the odds are high for a capacity mismatch.
Mirant does have a couple of options with their Welcome contract on Border; they can drop some of their Welcome gas off at a secondary upstream point, such as Marshall.
But their Aberdeen contract needs to flow at either Aberdeen or Warner on our system.
And if their capacity is stranded at Aberdeen on the 1st, I am confident that they will be giving both of us a call.
Between Aberdeen and Warner (our alternate delivery point to NWPS), we have the ability to deliver into this area an aggregate of over 70 MMcf/d.
If we do see firm and interruptible gas nominated into these points in excess of this amount, I feel Northern Border must zero out the interruptibles on our side - that was the issue that created so much heart burn for Pan Alberta years ago when we were forced to allocate Ventura.
But that is as far as we are planning to go.
We view the flow restriction to be on your side.
And we are suggesting that your priorities be used to allocate Aberdeen on the 1st.
If we do a firm allocation based on Border's priorities before we confirm, we would have a definite mismatch, and potentially nothing would be scheduled at the point.
Now that would not be all bad, given that we could use such an opportunity to deliver off the large OBA imbalance gas due NNG at the point.
But I don't think we want to fire up a battle with the shippers on both sides of the fence; we'll deal with Mirant on our end.
As for the Aberdeen OBA imbalance issue, I am still trying to come up with a long term solution to deal with that situation.
Any ideas as to how we can effectively eliminate the imbalance would be greatly appreciated, especially given the fact that the Energy Affiliate NOPR suggests that the flexibility we may have today could be restricted in the future.

1429,"The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.
We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.
We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.
Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.
Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:  Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.
Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.
Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.
The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.
Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.
For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.
The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.
Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.
In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.
If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

1439,"Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers!
How goes  the burly mountain man thing?
I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that  you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping  bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes.
(That second part I made up,  but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.)
All's well  here.
As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of  people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you  left.
There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions,  some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go.
That's just the nature of  this cutthroat business.
Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status  of my life in relation to Enron.
I am still here.
I still stare at the  computer.
Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner  that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, ""What does  it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a  disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?""
They are incredibly helpful.
I am still pretty much clueless about most  things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of  authority, as in, ""No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly  be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market  right now.
What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at  a time like this?""
It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is  why I'm still here.
But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the  great American outdoors.
I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office  will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to  coincide with that meltdown.
I haven't decided between a road trip through  the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris.
Both sound good,  and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive.
Well, I've managed to  say practically nothing for long enough now.
I do hope you're having an  amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I  believe Jack Kerouac once wrote.
We're all very proud of you here and  constantly refer to you as ""my good friend Winston who's skiing across the  state of Wyoming, which was my idea.""
I'd love to hear about your trip direct  from the source, although I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and  killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot.
But please do write  back....if you can still move your fingers.

Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:  Week of Jan 28:  We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications.
The packets will contain:  Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist  External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration  Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List  Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA).

Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.
A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com.
This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.
The Splash page will look something like the following:      Week of Feb. 4:  We will send out a mass mailing to approx.
3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site.
Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.
Week of Feb. 11:  The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).
General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
Trading/Origination Coordination  The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days.

1452,"Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits  which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.
The most  critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below.
The permits really  restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25  ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines.
We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.
Let me  know what additional information you may need.
1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest Operations.
2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.
At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions.
However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as  high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.
The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20% of the time.
TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.
The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lb/hr and ton/yr.
These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA Statement of Basis document).
Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.
Transwestern is requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.
3.
The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit.
4.
Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas.
Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel monitoring schedules to use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas.

1474,"Hunter,  IHS We met with IHS this morning to discuss the data that we need to complete our supply forecasts.
It is our intent to use the monthly historical production data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling permits to build a more accurate production forecast.
We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.
In order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services from IHS:  	US Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr.
delivered on CD-ROM monthly 	US Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr.
delivered on CD-ROM monthly  Next year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.
Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.
We will be able to do this after we build the historical well information into our supply forecast.
Danielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.
She anticipated having the contract today, and sending it to Chicago for approval.
PIRA Danielle is working to finalize the agreement in the next 3 days.
I gave her a list of the services that we needed, and told her that we would like to distribute the PIRA material on the Commodity Fundamentals website instead of having individual user accounts.
Based on the services that I think we'll need (North Americal Natural Gas, North American Electricity, and the Daily Demand Forecast), our combined cost for Gas and Power in Houston, Portland, Calgary, and Toronto should be around $100,000 for 100 users.
Danielle is going to send an e-mail when she has the final price.

Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold,  discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.
Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in  which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of  operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could  have such an impact.
Each table can report back as we gather to start the  afternoon.
Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move  Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and  lessons learned.
Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going  project.
Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool  for the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.
We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its  impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted  Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.
Monday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles  Center Field Terrace.
Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are  waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.
Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.
He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.
He will make an informal  presentation and then will entertain questions.
The rest of the morning will  be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action  steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information  provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office  services within Enron.
Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.
Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.

In the interim, he is convinced that only  Enron Corp. should be a swap party to these equity swaps, forwards, etc.
I  am going to speak with Rod Nelson (credit) and make some changes to our  approach.
This should also make life easier negotiating with Lehman and Bear  (from a credit perspecttive) but we'll reach an obvious stalemate when they  ask for an Enron Corp. resolution (forthcoming after the relevant board  meeting.

1508,"Sally,   here is a revised version of the savings for ENA, EGM, EIM, Back Office, Frameworks, and Corporate Systems.
There have been a number of changes as follows :-   Back Office The headcount numbers have changed because the original cuts took into account bugeted headcount counts rather than working from our currrent position.
Ramesh Rao spent some time today revising those figures to better represent what it will really take to address the three scenarios.
Also the changes reflect what it will take to support EA business only.
EES - at least, part of it - was supposed to be integrated into UNIFY early next year and therefore EES had a 20% allocation from the backoffice.
EGM/EIM Jeff made some slight alterations to make sure that current employee counts were accurate, and base cont/consultant headcount more on average budgeted for next year rather than actuals today.
They assumed in budgeting that contractors and consultants would be reduced next year as new dev in Thunderball, Freight and EIM started to be completed   The Summary page now shows savings rather than totals and all values are scaled to show millions....   regards

1510,"In reviewing the contracts, so far I have the following questions:  1.
Have Oman LNG and ADgas taken the risk of non-performance by DPC and  indirectly MSEB without any credit support?
The only security is the equity  in DPC?
Are such contracts typically secured or done with a buyer with deep  pockets?
How much value was put into DPC by the shareholders?
2.
Are there local public policy issues that could be addressed by local  courts with respect to the LNG contracts?
Fraud?
Bribery?
Are there any  local law issues with respect to performance or interpretation of the  contracts?
Isn't take-or-pay meaningless without credit support?
3.
What are the arguments for DPC to terminate the contracts?
Only where  the PPA is terminated?
Payments?
4.    Who negotiated the contracts?
Were there requests for credit support?
From Enron?
Did Enron ever promise to indirectly ""backstop"" the contracts by  its investment in Dabhol?
5.
What was the discussion regarding the ""reduction in operational  capability"" language in the contracts?
What was the language meant to  cover?
Do we need our counterparty's approval to investigate other markets?
6.
Is there any argument that DPC has already breached the contracts?
Could our counterparties issue a press release claiming damages over the  entire term of the contract?

It sounds like there are a few issues that need to be resolved.
1.
Apparently it has been decided that someone (?)
from UBS will be providing a curve beginning on day 1.
That person has yet to be identified.
2.
There will have to be a daily interpolation of the curve into ERMS on a daily basis.
This presents a couple of problems.
Someone must approve the interpolation, and the official curve does not come out until 5:00 P.M. Central Time.
This means that after the interpolation and system load,  it would probably be somewhere north of 6:00 PM before we could start our nightly process.
A difficult sell to say the least.
3.
There are offers out to two interest rate traders in Houston,  but we still have not determined whom we will be working with from a Houston perspective.
Hopefully,  decisions will be made by Monday.
Are you guys aware if there is a preliminary curve that we can use that comes out a bit earlier, and we can just have finance run with the official curve the next day?
Bottom Line : It sounds like they have worked out a process,  but not necessarily a great one.

My recommendation is that  we play it safe and assume we will need to file testimony on April 17.
To  that end, it's time to review some basics.
In its July 8, 1999 decision, the Commission stated:  ""We see reason to  pursue a change in protocol for receiving gas at Hector Road, even in the  short term.
If there are burdens that would unfairly fall upon Transwestern  customers is a window was established at Hector Road, we want to hear about  it in the next phase of the proceeding.
In addition, we seek specific  proposals as to how such an arrangement should be defined.""
Accordingly, the testimony we file should explain:  1.
The unfair harm that could potentially befall TW customers if Hector Road  were established as a formal receipt point 2.
Our proposal for making Hector a formal receipt point by establishing  primary and secondary receipt points 3.
Why our proposal is fair and consistent with Commission policy (here we  might want to draw analogies to the interstate system and explain why that  works)  I will also have an opportunity to make legal and policy arguments in a brief  after testimony has been filed.
Let's discuss how best to go about drafting the testimony.
I think the best  thing to do would be to outline the testimony, then decide who is going to  say what.

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

1548,"Many of you have been involved in recent efforts to either amend documents to  provide for rehypothecation of securities or additional collateral  arrangements, both resulting from cash constraints in the market.
In that  regard, it appears that our credit group will be very interested in accepting  different forms of government obligations, including Treasury Bills, Treasury  Notes and Treasury Bonds.
Our current version of Paragraph 13 does not have  the ""choice"" for Eligible Collateral consisting of longer dated obligations  such as Treasury Notes and Bonds; our earlier version did provide this  option.
LEGAL:  When preparing new master agreements, please be specific about credit  requests to include securities and verify with credit the specific types of  Eligible Collateral to be included in Paragraph 13.   CREDIT:  When drafting credit worksheets, please be  specific when requesting  types of Eligible Collateral other than cash.
We may consider amending Paragraph 13 again or adding additional forms of  Eligible Collateral to Library Doc.

1553,"I talked with Julie Smith right after lunch about ENA responding to Tennessee's South Texas Expansion.
The deadline to submit a response is this afternoon at 5:00 pm with the understanding that a binding precedent agreement with termination outs needs to be executed by tomorrow afternoon (i.e.
Thursday, November 29th).
I told Julie that I thought it was best if ENEL, rather than ENA, submitted the open season response and signed Tennessee's PA.  That way ENEL's RFP response would not get snarled up with any credit concerns that Tennessee had with the Enron Corp. announcements.
I told her that we were still an on-going concern and still wanted to sell gas to the project.
She appreciated our honesty and reaffirmed that ENEL was still interested in entering into a fuel supply arrangement with ENA.
Also, I just received an announcement from Rio Bravo Pipeline that said that ""due to the CFE changing the date on which the bidders must present their Bid Proposals for the Rio Bravo IV Project from December 4, 2001 to December 11, 2001"" that the Rio Bravo Pipeline Open Season was also being pushed back to December 7, 2001.
So it looks like ENEL has about another week to work on their proposal.

I just got off the phone with Tennessee Gas Pipeline to thank them for extending the Open Season for us and give him an update on participating in the expansion.

1558,"As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.
Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.
This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.
The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.
Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.
Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.
From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.
Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.
We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.
Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.
This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.
By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO.""
This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.
Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.
We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.
It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.
The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.
We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.
As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.
This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.
We will update you periodically on our process.
Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.
Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.
Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.
Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.
In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.
Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.
In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.
Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.
Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.
As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.
Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:  Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman  Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.
We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.
Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.
We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.
We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

Richard's input about the below was that it might not be suitable for direct distribution to customers but that it was acceptable for internal reference or talking points.
I don't think it can be condensed any more without losing important information.
SUMMARY  Upon becoming a NEPOOL member, EESI chose to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy requirement by issuance of Performance  Bond(s) via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, which issued a Performance Bond in the amount of $8,000,000.
On or about October 12, 2001, EESI received a letter from ISO New England dated October 10, 2001, indicating that EESI's current  Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase the amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.
In telephone conversations with ISO-NE, EESI was informed that in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be  resolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (October 19, 2001).
By October 16, EESI had requested a bond increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, but encountered delays in  working with the bond company.
EESI Credit Department personnel sent ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001, via FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for  revisions to the Performance Bond, and indicated EESI was working diligently to resolve the matter.
EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to delays with the bond company  as mentioned above.

1586,"Frank: I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns  with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.
She is going to add  language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is  considered to be ""signed"" and ""in writing"" if they are required by the  Website to click on it.
Her main concern given the fact that we now have a  Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a  GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers  the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a  GTC.
Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel  better.
Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I  will let you know if it is acceptable.
Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a ""test"" run  on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a  GTC.
I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product  description once they get their password.
I understand that you and Tana  will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the  ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time  so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.
Please call me if you have any questions.

1591,"Dear Mr. Lay:  You may not actually take time to read this email, but it will make me feel better having sent it.
I started with Enron 2 1/2 years ago in the ENA Volume Management Group.
Even after having 3 managers in the group, my reviews were outstanding, and after 1 1/2 years in the group, I decided to spread my wings.
I wanted to make a difference at Enron and I decided to take a position with Enron Global Markets, a growing and prosperous group at the time.
Once again, I was passed around through various managers, 3 to be exact, however I still received outstanding reviews.
With all of my reviews, always came the promise of being promoted with the next one.
However, with the last mid-year review, my boss knew that the time had come - but he encouraged me to wait until year-end, as my raise and bonus would be much better that way.
I knew that he was looking out for my best interest, as I am sure the other 5 managers had done along the way as well.
Unfortunately, the company took a turn for the worse and I could soon see that my future with this company that I sincerely loved was coming to an end.
I was one of the lucky ones, as I was not severed.
I knew that since I was a ???survivor??
?, all the hard work had been recognized and that is why I was considered a ??
?critical employee???.
But the longer I stayed, the more the uncertainty of the company became abundantly apparent to me and I knew I needed to do something to protect my career and myself.
I decided to seek employment outside of Enron.
I was fortunate.
I found something immediately.
I honestly believe it was because of my experience at Enron, along with having some of the best mangers and directors as mentors, that I was able to find such an opportunity.
I knew that the day would come that I would have to give notice, but I was hoping and praying that Enron Management would not do me wrong, as so many of my friends had been.
I knew that Enron would be fair and pay me my three weeks of vacation that I was due.
I was mistaken.
When it all came down to it, Enron in the end looked out for itself.
After receiving the run around, I was eventually told that I would not receive any of my vacation, although the rules had never been revised from previous years and nothing was ever clearly communicated from Human Resources.
I worked my ass off for Enron for 2 ??
years, and this company does not even have the decency to pay me my vacation.
I do know that my managers and directors received 90 day retention packages, that amounted to more that my annual compensation.
I know that some people within my own Enron Company were severed once it was determined that they had a job safely outside of Enron ??""
that way they were assured $4,500.
I also know that when notice was given for some employees, they were immediately severed, so that their benefits would not roll into the next month.
Again, they received their $4,500 and had a job lined up to immediately go to.
What are the rules?
How should these situations have been handled?
Should not each employee be treated fairly?
Time and time again, I stood behind Enron and you, Mr. Lay.
I honestly thought I would leave supporting Enron.
I thought it was the tragic mistake and greed of a FEW employees who took this company down.
However, based on my recent treatment, I have come to realize that there are more than a few greedy people in this company ??""
ones that have yet to be recognized.
All I wanted was the one extra check that was due me.
I earned my vacation.
I worked hard and supported this company ??""
and I am left with nothing, while management is left with thousands upon thousands of dollars.
I HAD to leave Enron to protect my future.
I never thought the day would come when my words regarding Enron would become resentful.
Sincerely,

1596,"As presently drafted the ETA provides that if a master agreement is in force  covering a particular transaction, the master controls.
I don't think we  ever adequately resolved the multiple Enron entity issue, though.
For  example, if a counterparty has an ISDA Master Agreement in place with ENA,  that master agreement could easily cover a trade based on UK gas prices.
However, it is not the commercial people's intent that the system work that  way.
They want every trade for a particular product to be with a single  Enron entity (e.g.
all UK gas transactions are with Enron Europe), regardless  of what master agreements are in place.
To resolve this I suggest that the  long descriptions be revised to state the Enron trading entity for each  product type (this is already in place for European derivatives) and that the  ETA be revised as follows:  revise the fifth line of paragraph (a) of Section 3 such that Transactions  are governed by the short and long definitions in respect of a product  ""...and any master agreement between Counterparty and the Enron entity  trading in such product on the Website which is in effect as of the date of  the execution of such Transaction...""

1599,"The proposed discipline below is designed to provide guidelines for HR generalists in addressing violations of the ""Internet Security Policy for the use of Electronic Media and Services"" to ensure consistency in the application of disciplinary measures.
In general, the discipline should follow the corrective action policy that has been established for addressing unacceptable conduct (see policy #11, corrective discipline).
The recommendations below are designed to address situations where employees transmit externally electronic communication that is ""discriminatory, harassing, threatening, derogatory, obscene, defamatory, a ""chain letter"" or junk mail, untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest or for personal profit"" (as outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics).
First Offense:  Automated electronic warning that the system has detected an inappropriate electronic mail being sent from the employee's mail box and that another violation will result in the HR Representative and Supervisor being notified and possible disciplinary action.
Also warning message refers employee to Internet Security Policy.
Second Offense:  Second automated electronic warning to employee with copy to HR Rep and Supervisor.
HR Rep and Supervisor to verbally warn employee to ensure understanding of Company policy.
Third Offense:  Third automated electronic warning to employee with a copy to Supervisor and HR.
HR Rep and Supervisor to give Written warning to employee to be placed in PH file.
Written warning to state that further violation may result in termination.
Fourth Offense:  System notice of shut down for continuing violation.
Copy of notice sent to HR Rep and Supervisor.
HR Rep and Supervisor to consult with Legal depart prior to employee termination for misconduct.
Using these guidelines, it is suggested that the  HR Rep and Management consider the specifics of the offense and determine the appropriate corrective action.
Other Issues/Considerations: Should we carve out transmissions that are ""untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest and for personal profit"" and have a more severe discipline for those situations?
Should same discipline be used when employees access inappropriate or pornographic sites.
Should we attempt to define all terms?
Is it appropriate to use a ""one size fit's all"" approach.
Should the discipline for transmitting motivational messages be the same as discipline for a threatening, obscene, derogatory, etc.
message?
How should we address inappropriate electronic messages transmitted internally?
Please route your comments to me or be prepared to discuss at our next meeting to be held Monday, July 23rd from 10:30 am to 11:30 am in EB 3824.

Currently it still appears as if the commercial book has more deals in it that the bankruptcy book.

Legal is deciding difference between ""executable"" contracts (able to negate deal) and ""forward"" contracts (collapse deal), with one interpretation being beneficial for EES and the other being beneficial for wholesale.

The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:  ?
Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.
The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.
?
After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.
As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.
Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.

1610,"As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.
Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.
This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.
The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.
Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.
Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.
From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.
Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.
We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.
Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.
This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.
By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO.""
This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.
Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.
We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.
It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.
The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.
We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.
As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.
This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.
We will update you periodically on our process.
Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.
Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.
Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.
Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.
In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.
Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.
In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.
Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.
Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.
As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.
Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:  Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman  Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.
We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.
Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.
We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.
We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

Anyway, tag #40700 was incorrect and BPA called about 3:45.
I cancelled that tag and replaced it with tag #40716 I hope what I did was okay, let me know if I should have done it differently.
On the NW sheet that tag number is highlighted in yellow in case there is a problem.

After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.
This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.
The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the 777 Clay garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.
This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage.
Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis.

1627,"Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.
This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.
In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.
We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.
Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.
We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.
In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.
For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.
In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.
This quarter they are reported separately.
Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.
Following are the highlights of our businesses:  Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.
Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.
Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.
While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.
Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.
So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.
Transportation and Distribution: 	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.
This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.
Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.
This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.
Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.
Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.
This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.
Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions.
This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.
In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.
Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.
These charges include: ?
A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp. ?
$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.
This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?
$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.
With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.
NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.
Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.
Here's how:  Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.
The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.

We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.
Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested.
We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.
Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging.
The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.

He gets used, first quality turbines that have been well maintained.
His  Utah turbines are something like 2 year old GE units that he bought from  Tokyo Electric (he said they had 4000 hours on them and were maintained in  typical electric utility gold plated style).

The president is Gary Remy, a Hispanic, wh= om you met recently at the YPO gathering.=20  2.=09DCB is in the broadband wireless access market focusing on smaller cit= ies in Texas.
They have deployed in nine different locations and have a st= rategy to grow from a regional player to a national player.
The market the= y are in requires no license fees and is one where being first to locate in=  a city is critical to success.
3.=09We have invested $2 million in DCB to date and brought in Redstone Inv= estors who also invested $2 million.
Redstone should continue to participat= e with us in any future investments we make in DCB.
4.=09We have talked to Kevin Garland  to solicit interest from him, however=  he made it clear that DCB was not in his target market and he was not inte= rested in the investment.
5.=09DCB has engaged Arthur Andersen to help raise additional funds for con= tinued growth.
We along with AA have been talking to other potential inves= tors and have found a receptive yet cautious reception.
6.=09About two weeks ago we were approached by representatives of Union Pac= ific Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railroad with a proposal to invest up to=  $75 million in DCB over the next five years beginning with an initial inve= stment of $15 million.
U P asked if Enron would be willing to invest a sim= ilar amount alongside them to help DCB grow into a national broadband wirel= ess access provider to smaller cities.
After this request I asked Ken Rice = if EBS would be interested in an investment in DCB either in conjunction wi= th U P or on a stand alone basis.
My hope was that EBS would view DCB as a=  strategic fit to their business model and would be interested in a much cl= oser relationship with DCB perhaps leading to a buyout.
( Although EBS and =  DCB are in different businesses I know that the trading group of EBS has u= sed DCB to provide liquidity and last mile access for many of their trades.= )  Ken's response was that EBS was not interested in an investment in DCB a= nd he didn't see a strategic fit between the two companies.
=20  7.=09We have also talked to Lou's group, the Xcelerator, and to LJM about i= nvestments in DCB and it appears that LJM is very interested in committing = funds however I don't think they will be ready in time to match U P's commi= tment.
8.
=09At a subsequent meeting with U P we told them not to expect any addit= ional funds from Enron other that a possible $2 to $3 million from ourselve= s since that is all of the capacity that we have left for this investment.
=  They are very disappointed that Enron does not see the strategic potential=  of this business the way they do, but nevertheless are still moving forwar= d in their efforts to invest in DCB in the $75 million range.
We are curre= ntly in the due diligence process with U P and hope to wrap up a deal struc= ture by the end of May.
=09 We have solicited the support of other Enron groups all along the way w= hile making our investment decision.
I truly believe that DCB is in a spac= e that could be very integral to the success of EBS and had hoped that we c= ould work together more closely, however EBS does not see a strategic fit w= ith DCB.
We will continue to develop relationships with other strategic an= d financial partners in order to enhance and grow the value of our investme= nt in DCB.
=09I will be happy to talk to you further about DCB and our investment.
We=  will of course seek your approval for any additional investments that we m= ake in DCB.
Please call me if you have any additional questions.

1675,"Mark:  Per our conversation, I understand that the Canadian company has a number of  outstanding OTC FX transactions with one or more counterparties.
Each of  those transactions should be documented by a confirmation which confirms the  economic terms of each deal.
Each confirmation must be subject to (1) an  existing type of master agreement (such as the ISDA, IFEMA, FEOMA), (2) a  ""deemed"" version of such an agreement or (3) ""terms and conditions"" appearing  in the confirmation itself.
It is quite likely that in any of these three  types of confirmations, there are provisions for assignment of trades, credit  event upon merger, material adverse change, additonal events of default or  termination, etc.
which may be triggered by the pending acquisiton of the  Canadian company.
Further, there may be credit issues associated with the  transactions and/or master agreements (in the form of specific credit  provisions in a confirmation or a credit annex to the master agreement).
As  a result, a party attempting to ""step into the shoes of the Canadian company""  must review the existing documents, subject to any confidentiality  restrictions, in order to evaluate the positions and risks associated with  assuming those positions.
Thus, we need to conduct a thorough due diligence of the financial trading  positions of the Canadian company.

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.
To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.
Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.
Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.
After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.
Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.
I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.

(Planners has an established relationship with Enron Field and coordinated ECT's Holiday party there last year.)
Each vendor gave creative presentations and were very similar in capabilities.
While Ward & Ames provided sound ideas in their proposal, there were a few aspects that affected the final decision.

Enron expects to announce its joint venture partner within weeks, according to Bienenstock.
The joint venture would use that institution's financial means to guarantee that Enron would pay its bills.
Also Monday, at a court hearing Enron announced $1.5 billion in debtor in possession financing from a syndicate led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.
The company said that it needs about $250 million for immediate operating needs.
Currently, Enron has about $500 million in cash.

A few notes...
There is some great reporting functionality in this database.
Check out some  of the sorts on the left.
There is a drop down called ""Pending Swap  Update"".
That sort will create a list of all executed and draft financial  agreements.
There are ways you can sort the Pending Swap Update to generate  reports for you compan  The ""restrictions"" column should be limited to only those issues that are  critical to trading/confirmations/settlement.
Kinda, before you do/authorize  a trade read this.
Not for general legal notes.
Once an agreement's status is coded ""executed"", it should never be coded  elsewise (it will mess up reporting).
If you are amending an agreement or  superseding and replacing one, code the status ""executed-under amendment"".
I should be the only one coded to change the ""keywords"" in the drop downs.
If you need keywords added, send me an email and I will add them for you.
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA  definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption  provisions.
This information should be inputted for the new master swap  agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and  repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.
Also, FYI, the ""See"" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and  mergers reference.

In other upcoming events, the Oregonians for Nebraska 3rd Annual Founders  Day celebration is scheduled for Saturday, March 9th.
The festivities will kickoff with an exclusive social hour for Blackshirt Club members only from 6 to 6:30 pm.
A social hour with a no host bar including a silent auction for all others will start at 6:30 with dinner served at 7:30 pm.
Throughout the evening, there will be door prizes and an exclusive raffle for those attending who are Alumni Association members.
The event is taking place at McMenamins Edgefield Manor in Troutdale.
Edgefield is a unique  European-style village, which includes lodging, a pub with a movie theater, fine dining, a winery, a brewery, distillery, golf course, gardens, vineyards, artwork, meeting, wedding and banquet space, and special events year round.
Edgefield, built in 1911, served for several decades as the Multnomah County Poor Farm.
Residents operated a self-sufficient environment, raising hogs, poultry, growing a variety of fruits and vegetables, operating a dairy, cannery and meat packing plant as well as working in the laundry, kitchen and hospital.
In 1947, it was  renamed the Multnomah County Home and Farm and in the late fifties the farm operation was eliminated.
In 1962, the facitity was renamed Edgefield Manor and for the last two decades of operation, functioned as a nursing home and eventually closed in 1982.
McMenamins purchased the property from Multnomah County in 1990.
In phases lasting over four years, the condemned buildings and land were transformed into a place that is quite special.
Edgefield also offers over 100 bed and breakfast rooms creating a unique lodging experience.
Spacious rooms are furnished with cozy and inviting  decor from the turn of the century.
Televisions and telephones are absent  from the rooms, encouraging a tranquil retreat atmosphere.
If you are interested in spending the night on the 9th, contact Edgefield directly at 503-669-8610.
Be sure to mention that you are with the Oregonians for  Nebraska for discounted room rates.
Our speakers this year include the dean of the Nebraska football coaching  staff, George Darlington and Chancellor of the University Harvey Perlman.
Coach Darlington is the only remaining member of Tom Osborne's original Husker staff.
Darlington is just finished his 29th season with the Huskers and his 16th as Nebraska's secondary coach.
Darlington originally  tutored the defensive ends for 13 seasons.
Chancellor Perlman took over the reins of the University in 2000.

1725,"As I'm sure you're all aware, it took the group a day or two to hit its stride after EOL was launched on Aug. 20.
We have already received approximately 30 disputes filed by various counterparties regarding deals that flowed on the 20th and 21st.
Many of these will be especially difficult to settle correctly given the fact there is virtually no documentation or information to be found regarding the original deal.
Some deals done on EOL were altered; other bilateral trades were simply zeroed out; and still others exist only in the Inc sheets.
This situation outlines the extreme importance of documenting changes in deals as they're being made.
If you have reason to zero out a trade done by an earlier shift, or to alter a trade executed online, please convey that reason.
Some suggestions:  1.
If you have a notebook, and use it, please enter the date on the top of the page every time you start a shift.
Without that, your notes are pretty much worthless.
2.
Type a short note into the Scheduling Comments section of deals you zero out or change, especially if you're changing them much later than the time they were entered.
3.
Use the superfluity of spreadsheets, discussion databases, reports, Enpower applications, cut sheets, and other pieces of paper available to the Real Time group as evidence of your activity while on shift.

1726,"BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  Enron Global Markets  In a combined effort, Global Risk Markets (GRM), a unit of Enron Global Markets, and Southeast Power Origination, part of Enron Americas, closed Enron's first Contingent Call Outage Option in the 1st quarter 2001.
The product was created to provide customers with a cost effective risk management tool to hedge against high commodity prices after experiencing an unplanned power generation outage.
The transaction was entered into with UtiliCorp United to manage its generation risk for summer 2001.
This risk is associated with a forced outage of their largest coal unit during peak summer demand.
The transaction, which was developed jointly with the Southeast Power group, highlights the benefits of cooperation between business units within Enron.
GRM is working with a number of business units to integrate this risk management product into other Enron businesses to enhance value to our customers.

As discussed, it would be beneficial if TW would be able to discuss the operating parameters along TW's pipeline system prior to and after the proposed Red Rock expansion.

Discuss potential system or operating modifications to allow Window Rock deliveries.
4.  Review potential alternative delivery points into TW for backhaul service.

We don't  know when the service will be reinstated; but in the meantime you can reflect  on what life was like before the darn thing was invented.
Bell, Alexander Graham                   b. , March 3, 1847, Edinburgh                 d. Aug. 2, 1922, Beinn Bhreagh, Cape Breton Island, Nova  Scotia, Can.
Scottish-born American audiologist best known as the inventor  of                 the telephone (1876).
For two generations his family had been                 recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech  correction,                 with Alexander Melville Bell's Standard Elocutionist passing  through                 nearly 200 editions in English.
Young Bell and his two  brothers were                 trained to continue the family profession.
His early  achievements on                 behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before  his 30th                 birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training.
Alexander (""Graham"" was not added until he was 11) was the  second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds  Bell.
Apart  from one year at a private school, two years at Edinburgh's Royal High  School (from  which he was graduated at 14), and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh  University and at University College in London, Bell was largely family  trained and  self-taught.
His first professional post was at Mr. Skinner's school in  Elgin, County  Moray, where he instructed the children in both music and elocution.
In 1864  he  became a resident master in Elgin's Weston House Academy, where he conducted  his  first studies in sound.
Appropriately, Bell had begun professionally as he  would  continue through life--as a teacher-scientist.

The west gas desk would like to send a mailout to our EOL customers  regarding the new opportunity to trade ""odd lots"" on every physical product.
EOL has been instrumental in providing liquidity to previously illiquid  physical delivery points in the west for standard volumes of 5000 mmbtu/d and  greater, but we would like to notify our customers that EOL will now  accommodate odd size lots, in 1 mmbtu increments.
This will allow us to  trade the ""non-standard"" volumes with all of the market.
Do we have a creative team that might be able to assist us in our efforts?
We were thinking about a one page mailout with a clear message.
We would  like it to be very upbeat and funny.

1767,"Group,  Cuts are on the way.
While most can be zeroed out in Enpower (for LD's) like normal, longterm contracts will require an annuity for the value of the cut on that particular day.
In the interest of being uniform, the guidelines for cuts are below.
We will be handling cuts in the following manner:  1.
Documentation is priority #1.
We need to fill out a cut sheet with the times, the name of the person who called, the tag number, the quantity and price.
2.
After attempting to resupply the cut or find an alternate sink we need to carefully document changes in the new enpower workspace.
3.
We need to zero out all cut deals in Enpower, we then need to calculate the value of the deals and make an annuity.
The annuity must be made HE 1 on the following day of the schedule.
The annuity needs to be for 1 mw for the value of the zeroed out contract.
In the comment section of the annuity you must include the Enpower deal # of the cut deal and should include an indication of the number of mws each hour and the contract price--for example (4 hours @ 25 mws X $100 per mw = $10,000).

Here are some quick thoughts.
Sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share.
Be happy to discuss further.
Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.
Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs).
Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.
In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.
It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.
When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.

1805,"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.
In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.
Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.
He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.
Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.
Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets.
He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.
Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.
In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.
I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.
I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.
Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.
But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.
The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.
Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

1809,"John,  I met with Sasha today for approx.
3 hours.
We reviewed the exact process for inputting data into Eterra and verifying the trades prior to being sent to the QSE MOS.
Here are some suggestions that I made to Sasha for improving Eterra (the top of the list is the highest priority):   - Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades, such as a simultaneous Buy from Calpine (South Zone) and a Sell to FPL (North Zone).
Currently, this has to be done by entering two trades, a purchase from Calpine (South Zone) to the Hourly Ercot book and a second entry of Hourly Ercot book     to FPL (North Zone).
Sasha said he is working on this, but problems are occurring due to the transmission between South and North.
- Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation.
The current process is to input a buy from Frontera into the Frontera book.
This is not very intuitive and we are still trying to work out an easier process.
(Possibly even having a button that we can click to indicate that    it is a purchase from Frontera.
Essentially, this would increase the EPMI mw's in the Ercot Portal.)
- Change the short name in <internal counterpary> & <external counterparty> to the actual long name, (i.e.
- elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy)   - Give us a list of Counterparties and the appropriate QSE, (i.e.
- El Paso Merchant is actually APX)     So that we know what it will affect in the Ercot Portal.
- Match flow date to automatically update the Contract date.
One less step that we need to worry about.
I tried to impress upon Sasha that in trading ""time is of the essence"" and that we don't have much time to input data.
Therefore, we need to streamline the deal entry process and to make it more user friendly.
I realize that the first two items will take some time, but the last 3 items should be quick fixes.
I hope this helps.

1817,"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.
Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.
We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.
While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.
The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.
It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.
We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.
Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.
Ken    Dear ETS Colleague:  On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.
The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.
In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.
Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.
The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.
For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.
Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.
Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.
Keep up the good work!

With the October month-end close fast approaching, we want to provide you with an update as to the progress made in identifying and addressing the root causes for slow system response.
Poor Performing Programs The ISC has identified a number of poor performing programs.
Some program redesign has already occurred with continued efforts proceeding through year end.
In addition, system and data base parameters as well as indexes have been tuned.
These actions have resulted in improvements that should enable Enron to realize better system response in the upcoming close.
Workload Distribution The ISC has identified jobs, both scheduled and user submitted, that result in system ""bottlenecks"".
We have accelerated the purchase of system hardware to provide additional capacity and expect this upgrade to occur prior to year-end close.
In addition, the ISC has implemented a plan to provide business users with more information regarding efficient methods of report execution.
Workshops are currently being conducted with key ""close-users"" from the various business units to provide techniques that will enable more efficient report execution during the close process.
Improved Close Monitoring The ISC has been working to heighten the monitoring of key close jobs in order to more effectively identify and resolve close related issues.
An initiative is underway to improve the utilization of automated tools to better monitor, identify, and escalate close-related problems.
Communication Strategy Implement The ISC has established a plan to more effectively communicate to our customers in the event of future system performance issues.
This plan will ensure that information will be provided to users regarding system performance and resolution status in a timely manner.

This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.
To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.
Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.
The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.

I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.
During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.
I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.

1860,"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.
Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.
We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.
While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.
The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.
It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.
We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.
Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.
Ken    Dear ETS Colleague:  On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.
The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.
In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.
Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.
The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.
For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.
Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.
Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.
Keep up the good work!

1891,"I don't know if Perry has responded to your request yet concerning what contracts are expiring with WTX Pool capacity and about that Duke contract you mentioned in our Staff Mtg yesterday, but I looked at my notes and this is what I come up with.
The Duke contract that expires 7/31/2002 without ROFR is already taken into consideration as expired in the November, 2002 capacity of 17,300/d we derived last week (which we've already sold 20,000/d to Calpine & PPL).
Other contracts expiring in 2002 & early 2003 from the WTX Pool are:  	25841	PG&E	17,200/d	10/31/2002	(ROFR trigger 10/31/01) 	26511	PG&E	  8,165/d	10/31/2002	(ROFR trigger 10/31/01) 	Total		25,365/d  	26683	APS	8,000/d		3/31/2003	(subject to ROFR) 		 Otherwise, we have WTX Pool capacity every Apr-Oct of 14,000/d (opposite of SWG's seasonal ctrc).
The other issue we could take into consideration here is displacement.
For the month of November, 2002 (for example) we have 22,000/d of capacity we are including in our WT-1 total that is made up of southward paths (20,000/d for USGT & 2,000/d for Astra with receipts north of WT-1 for delivery to WTX delivery points south of WT-2).
This is the most conservative capacity reservation policy.
In the event not enought physical receipts were nominated south of WT-1 to fulfill all physical deliveries nominated south of WT-1, we would need to compress gas south through WT-1 to make deliveries for these two contracts.
We may want to reassess this.

On Monday Jan. 7th the legislature recovenced and Gov.
Davis delivered his State of the State Address on Tuesday.
Davis focused on the projected $12.5 billion budget shortfall and increased education spending.
Gov.
Davis pledged he will not advocate increasing taxes and his proposed budget for closing the gap will include a combination of cutbacks, deferred spending, internal borrowing and accelerated revenue.
On Thursday, Assemblyman Herb Wesson, Jr. was elected as Speaker of the Assembly.
Assemblyman Wesson is a Culver City Democrat.
Also on Thursday, Gov.
Davis submitted his balanced budget without tax increases.
Key and controversial provisions to cover the shortfall included borrowing from teacher and state worker pension funds, cashing in on future year revenues from the tobacco settlement and spending cuts of $5.2 billion largely from health and welfare programs.

1903,"As you know, exceeding this limit would require contacting the Enron Board of  Directors.
Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.
In  conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily  report from Ted on component V@R.  Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston  time) to let me know about this requirement.
Obviously, we want to meet  Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and  complete  as possible.
Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over  the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be  excluded from the first run of component V@R.  (Mike:  I assume that you are  very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send  to the daily 8:30 meeting.)
I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh  and me at 4:00 today.
Realizing that the time was very late in London, we  tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in  the meeting.
Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that  Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.
Here is the key fact to know:  It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R  calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.
The  Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing  an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.
With this  timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by  approximately 10:00 am Houston time.
Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R  including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power)  will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston  time (10:00 am London time).
If this time frame is not met, then component  V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.
We had hoped to discuss this with  you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support  and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London  requirement for officialized books.
The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on  what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread  options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.
Those V@R calculations  that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the  component V@R calculations.
While there are other commodities that will  currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less  material than the UK spread options.
Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of  days before this is completed.
Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of  this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.
I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the  UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time.
We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.
It is  probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and  systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report  earlier in the morning.
Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or  not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently  meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London.

1904,"Hello  Long time no see or hear!!
Thank you for sending me a note - I've only just got into this e mail lark as we didn't have it on the computors at work until this year - and then I'm not supposed to be using it oh well.
How is America?
I had no idea that you where there or that you had  had a baby, Denise came to Majorca this summer and she filled me in on peoples whereabouts.
How old is you little boy and what's his name.
It's winter season here and very little work to do - that's why I am e mail mad  to try and fill in my time.
Only got 2 days left and then I am finished until Feb, depending on how things go with bookings etc after New York.
I usually go home for Christmas every year but my nana died  at the beginning of the year and now we don't have a base to stay (me, sally and mum) so i am going home on the 8th of Dec until the 18th and having Christmas here instead.
My mum has been here for 2 years now, well 2 summers and a bit of winter.
she originally came to help me with Louisa just after she was born as I went back to work when she was 3 months and mum looked after her for me during the day, but now as she hasn't got nana to look after she decided to come back and helps me out a lot as my hours are not always a straight 9-5.
Louisa goes to nursery during the week  and mum and I juggle the hours between us ( I say mum and I as Toni is about as useful as a chocolate fireguard )  My sister is an art director for Vidal Sasson, doing very well for herself, she runs the new salon in the city in London and is always jetting of to Japan and other exciting `places, still single no children but loves Louisa to bits.
Anyway enough about me, how is life in America,  do you work or are you a lady of leisure?
Louisa is nearly 3, but I imagine your little boy isn't at school yet is he?
does he look like you or your husband?
Louisa is blond with blue eyes, nothing like either myself or Toni - she is very much like my sister and my dad.
I have been at the hospital today to see a specialist with her as she was born with a lump in her neck (which he has told us will have to be removed in later years) she also has a mark on the back of her head and a birthmark between her lip and her nose which a lot of people comment about but I am very used to.
She has noe to go and see another specialist about these 2 things and then hopefully eveything will be sorted out, apart from that ahe is nearly 3 but every thinks she is at least 4 as she is very tall and well built unfortuanately the only thing she has got from her father is his Majorcian temperment!!
Say hello to your mum and dad and Paul, if you are in the Uk at the same time as me let me know as I would love to see you all.

1905,"As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.
We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.
Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.
In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.
Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.
In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.
It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.
To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.
If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

I am afraid that the baseload  volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books.
We need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk.
i.e.
Intra  regional spreads with GD swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then  booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty.
Janie managing SJ and  laying off risk on Steve's Opal.
I know that the cash books would be a good  idea for dailies , but I am not sure how to do this without giving up the  cash risk for baseload as well.
What are your thoughts?
I would also like to discuss the staffing issues.
Matt Smith and Susan Scott  to analyst,  Jay to the ROX, etc.
It seems like Ken S. has shown more  interest in the west fundies lately.
Should we keep his services?
The basis products need another book.
Who can we add to the mix?
I think  that we should look into having Frank focus on prompt month only.
He has a  great interest in cash and fundies and this should serve him well in managing  tight two ways for all products on the prompt.
Keith can do term with  another book.
Monique is going to take over the gd swaps for Kern, SJ, and Perm.
I will  continue to manage the CA products.
This should allow us to provide tighter  two ways across the west.
I will continue to manage all index products and  prompt month phys fixed price.
Operations needs more labor as well as an analyst or two to monitor flows.
The analysts will monitor flows by price and hopefully find creative ways to  nom the market.
EOL.
Keith has a great idea of opening up all products to the desk so that  you may insert a bid or an offer inside of the manager's markets.
We should  propose this to EOL.
This would allow for tighter markets on all products  and prevent the desk from working markets through the brokers.
Ca cash products.

1930,"The particulars of the transaction:  We are obligated to deliver 25 MW of power to WALC at Pinnacle Peak through 12/31/04.
The company receives $45 for each MW delivered to WALC.
Pinnacle Peak is not a liquid trading hub.
There are only two utilities with facilities at Pinnacle Peak, WALC and APS.
We are currently utilizing APS transmission to deliver energy to WALC during off peak hours.
The cost of the APS transmission is $1.95.
The energy to satisfy this obligation is available at Four Corners under contract from El Paso Electric.
The energy from El Paso is contracted to be purchased through the end of this year under a prepetition agreement at a fixed price of $22.25.
The Transmission Service Agreement will be terminated by APS for nonpayment of  a prepetition obligation of $43,708.60.
APS is the sole party able to provide transmission to Pinnacle Peak at this time.
Absent the ability to purchase transmission from APS, the company will be forced to settle the WALC obligation at above market prices due to the illiquidity at Pinnacle Peak.
These costs could run as high as $5.
The inablity to purchase APS transmission for $1.95 will increase the company's costs by as much as $3 over the term of the WALC obligation.
There are approximately 95,000 MWh remaining to be delivered to WALC for the remainder of 2001 on light load hours.
The increased cost to deliver would result in an additional expense of $285,000 for the remaining deliveries this year.
The increased cost for the entire term of the WALC agreement could exceed $1,000,000.

The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday.
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies.
Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project.
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said.

I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.
Here's a rundown of events from last week:  	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.
Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.
We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.
The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.
As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.
Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.
Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.
All agency ratings are investment grade.
Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:  	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.
Transaction counts remain higher than average.
EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.
EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.
