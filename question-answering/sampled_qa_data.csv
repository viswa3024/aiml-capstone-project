When a model is given the training data, it shows 100 percent accuracy—technically a slight 
loss. But, when we use the test data, there may be an error and low efficiency. This condition is 
known as overfitting. 
There are multiple ways of avoiding overfitting, such as:

The Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) objective was removed from consideration, since the original paper's authors observed equal or slightly better performance on downstram tasks with the NSP loss removed.
The authors trained the model with bigger batch sizes and longer sequences, which aids the Masked Language Modelling objective, leading to better end-task accuracy.
Instead of obtaining a single static mask during the preprocessing of data (BERT), the data is duplicated and masked on ten different occassions, with different masking patterns on each occassion over multiple epochs.

532,"Can you explain how the Transformer architecture can be used for graph-based data, such as social networks or molecule structures?","Ans. The Transformer architecture can be adapted for graph-based data by using a technique called “graph attention.” In graph attention, the input to the network consists of a graph structure, where each node in the graph represents a data point and each edge represents a relationship between the data points. The Transformer uses multi-head attention to attend to different parts of the graph, allowing it to capture complex dependencies between different nodes and edges. This approach has been successfully applied to a variety of graph-based data, such as social networks and molecule structures, and has achieved state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks.",4

Without positional encoding, the network may be unable to capture sequential dependencies effectively. The positional encoding is added to the input embeddings of each token. That allows the network to learn positional information along with semantic information.",4

Unlike other types of attention mechanisms, which only attend to a fixed set of tokens or features, self-attention can attend to any combination of tokens or features in the input sequence. This allows the network to capture complex dependencies between different parts of the input sequence, improving its ability to make accurate predictions.",4
635,"What is model pruning, and how does it help in deploying models on resource-constrained devices?","Model pruning involves removing unnecessary weights from a neural network, reducing its size and making it suitable for deployment on devices with limited resources.",4
636,Describe the basic components of a Transformer model.?,"The basic components include the encoder and decoder, each consisting of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks.",4
637,What are context-free models?,"Context-free models, such as GloVe, generate a single word embedding representation for each word in the vocabulary. This means that certain words that have multiple meanings, will have the same inherent representation in very different sentences. For example, 'parks' will have the same context-free representation in 'he parks his car' and 'she likes going to water parks'.",4
638,What is image-to-image translation?,Image-to-image translation is a task in computer vision where the goal is to convert an image from one domain to another  maintaining the underlying structure.,4

646,"When does the linear regression line stop rotating or finds an optimal spot where it 
is fitted on data? 
","A place where the highest RSquared value is found, is the place where the line comes to rest. 
RSquared represents the amount of variance captured by the virtual linear regression line with 
respect to the total variance captured by the dataset. ",4
647,When should you use classification over regression,"Classification produces discrete values and dataset to strict categories, while regression gives 
you continuous results that allow you to better distinguish differences between individual points. 
You would use classification over regression if you wanted your results to reflect the 
belongingness of data points in your dataset to certain explicit categories (ex: If you wanted to 
know whether a name was male or female rather than just how correlated they were with male 
and female names.) ",4
648,"What is data augmentation? Can you give some examples?
","Data augmentation is a technique for synthesizing new data by modifying existing data in such a 
way that the target is not changed, or it is changed in a known way. 
CV is one of the fields where data augmentation is very useful. There are many modifications 
that we can do to images: 
● Resize 
● Horizontal or vertical flip 
● Rotate 
● Add noise 
● Deform 
● Modify colors 
Each problem needs a customized data augmentation pipeline. For example, on OCR, doing 
flips will change the text and won’t be beneficial; however, resizes and small rotations may help. ",4
649,What are the different types of contextual models? Is BERT a contextual model or a context-free model?,"The different types of contextual models are:

Unidirectional Contextual Models
Bidirectional Contextual Models.
Unidirectional Contextual Models represent words based on all of their previous context. This means that each word is contextualized with respect to only the words before it, and not after it.
BERT is a Bidirectional Contextual Model, and this is why it is considered a deeply bidirectional model.",4
650,"How does the attention mechanism in a Transformer network work, and what advantages does it offer over other types of neural network architectures?","Ans. The attention mechanism in a Transformer network allows the network to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence when making predictions. This is accomplished by calculating a set of attention weights for each input token, which determine the relative importance of each token for the current prediction. The attention mechanism has several advantages over other types of neural network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including the ability to capture long-range dependencies more effectively and the ability to handle variable-length input sequences.",4
651,How does FastAPI integrate with SQLAlchemy for database connection and ORM?,"FastAPI integrates with SQLAlchemy through the use of Pydantic models and dependency injection. First, a SQLAlchemy model is defined for the database structure. Then, a Pydantic model is created to handle data validation and serialization. FastAPI uses these models in route functions to interact with the database.
Dependency injection allows for reusable dependencies that manage database sessions. A common pattern involves creating a function that yields a session, then closes it after request handling. This function can be included as a parameter in route functions, providing them with a session instance.",4

654,What are descriptors and it's types,"Descriptors or features are the information extracted from images in terms of numerical values that are difficult to understand and correlate by a human. Suppose we consider the image as data the information extracted from the data is known as features. Generally, features extracted from an image are of much lower dimension than the original image. The reduction in dimensionality reduces the overheads of processing the bunch of images.

Basically, there are two types of descriptors extracted from the images based on the application. They are local and global descriptors:

Global descriptors are generally used in image retrieval, object detection and classification. They describe the image as a whole to generalize the entire object, generally including contour representations, shape descriptors, and texture features.
Local descriptors are used for object recognition/identification. They describe the image patches (key points in the image) of an object and usually represent the texture in an image patch.
Generally, for low-level applications such as object detection and classification, global features are used and for higher-level applications such as object recognition, local features are used. The combination of global and local features improves the accuracy of the recognition with the side-effect of computational overheads",4
655,"Can you explain how the Transformer architecture can be used for speech recognition tasks, and what challenges are associated with this application?","Ans. The Transformer architecture can be adapted for speech recognition tasks by using a technique called “speech attention.” In speech attention, the input to the network consists of a sequence of audio features, which are transformed into a sequence of higher-level representations using convolutional or recurrent layers. The Transformer then uses multi-head attention to attend to different parts of the audio sequence, allowing it to capture complex dependencies between different parts of the audio data.

However, speech recognition tasks present challenges, such as dealing with variable-length audio sequences and handling noisy audio data. Focus your answer on the challenges and try to elaborate as this is one of the most essential transformer interview questions.",4
656, Explain Principle Component Analysis (PCA,"PCA is a method for transforming features in a dataset by combining them into uncorrelated 
linear combinations. 
These new features, or principal components, sequentially maximize the variance represented 
(i.e. the first principal component has the most variance, the second principal component has 
the second most, and so on). 
As a result, PCA is useful for dimensionality reduction because you can set an arbitrary 
variance cutoff. ",4
657,"How does the SVM algorithm deal with self-learning? 
","SVM has a learning rate and expansion rate which takes care of this. The learning rate 
compensates or penalises the hyperplanes for making all the wrong moves and expansion rate 
deals with finding the maximum separation area between classes. ",4
658,What are the types of features in CV,"Input image: a computer receives a visual input from an imaging device like a camera. This is typically captured as an image or a sequence of images forming a video.
Pre-processing: Each image is sent through some pre-processing steps whose purpose is to standardize each image. Common preprocessing steps include resizing an image, blurring, rotating, changing its shape, or transforming the image from one color to another. Only by standardizing each image, can you then compare them and further analyze them in the same way.
Next, comes Feature extraction. Features are what help us define certain objects, and they’re usually information about object shape or color. For example, some features that distinguish the shape of a motorcycle’s wheel, headlights, mudguards, and so on. The output of this process is a features vector, which is a list of unique shapes that identify the object.
Finally, these features are fed into an ML model, in the example, a classification model. This step looks at the features vector from the previous step and predicts the class of the image. As you can see in the above example, the dog has the lowest probability of 1% whereas there’s an 85% probability that this is a motorcycle.
To improve the accuracy, we may need to do more of step 1 (acquire more training images) or step 2 (more processing to remove noise) or step 3 (extract better features) or step 4 (change the classifier algorithm and tune some hyperparameters or even more training time). Many different approaches can improve the performance of the model. They all lie in one or more of the pipeline steps.",4

661,What is the difference between BERT Base and BERT Large?,"The difference between BERT Base and BERT Large lies in the number of encoder layers that they possess. BERT Base contains 12 encoder layers stacked one on top of the other, whereas BERT Large contains 24 encoder layers stacked one on top of the other. This difference makes BERT Large the better performer, but it also the need for more computational power as well as memory.",4
662,What is the difference between the Test set and validation set?,"The test set is used to test or evaluate the performance of the trained model. It evaluates the predictive power of the model.

665,"How does the Transformer architecture handle tasks that require modeling, both the sequence and the context, such as question answering?","Ans. The Transformer architecture can handle tasks that require modeling both the sequence and the context by using a special type of input encoding called the “segment embedding”. The segment embedding allows the network to distinguish between different parts of the input sequence, such as the question and the answer, and to attend to them separately. Additionally, the Transformer can be combined with other types of models, such as convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks, to handle tasks that require modeling both sequential and contextual information.",4
